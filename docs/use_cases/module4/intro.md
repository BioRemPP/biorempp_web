# 4 – Functional and Genetic Profiling

This module bridges the gap between system-level structure and mechanisms. After identifying how samples cluster and rank in terms of their functional and chemical potential, we now focus on *what* each sample can do at a finer resolution and *how* these capabilities are encoded at the genetic level. The analyses in this section are organized to mirror the decision-making process of a researcher or engineer selecting candidates for specific bioremediation tasks: from broad functional fingerprints, to targeted candidate selection, down to gene-level architecture. The goal is to provide actionable, biologically interpretable profiles that can support both practical solutions and hypothesis-driven experimentation.

### 4.1. What are the comprehensive functional potential of each individual sample?

We first construct a detailed functional profile—or "fingerprint"—for every sample. This involves characterizing its full repertoire of metabolic pathways and ranking its most prominent enzymatic activities, typically using the diversity and abundance of associated genes (e.g., KO richness) as key indicators. Through this lens, we can obtain a nuanced understanding of each sample's primary metabolic strengths and specializations. Samples can then be classified along a continuum from versatile "generalists," which encode broad and diverse functional repertoires, to "specialists," which concentrate their capacity on a narrower set of highly developed pathways.

### 4.2. For a specific function, which samples are the most capable candidates?

Once individual profiles are established, the analysis shifts to a task-oriented, comparative perspective. Instead of asking "what can each sample do?", we ask: *for a given metabolic pathway, functional category, or chemical class of interest, which samples are best equipped to perform the corresponding task?* We address this by ranking samples according to function-specific metrics such as the number of unique KOs, gene counts, or pathway completeness associated with the selected function. The result is a direct, data-driven procedure for identifying elite candidate samples tailored to predefined bioremediation challenges, such as the degradation of a particular pollutant or class of compounds.

### 4.3. What is the underlying genetic and hierarchical architecture of these key functions?

To achieve a mechanistic understanding of the observed potential, we finally decompose the genetic and structural basis of high-priority functions. We map detailed gene inventories associated with selected pathways to distinguish core genetic components (consistently present across samples) from accessory or auxiliary elements (present only in subsets of samples). In parallel, we explore the hierarchical organization of these pathways—from genes and reactions to modules and full metabolic routes—and provide tools to query specific gene–sample and gene–compound associations. This level of resolution can enable the construction of detailed mechanistic profiles for each function and sample, supporting hypothesis generation, strain engineering strategies, and the design of targeted experimental validations.
