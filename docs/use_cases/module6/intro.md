# 6 – Hierarchical and Flow-based Functional Analysis

While previous modules focus on ranking, clustering, and profiling individual entities (samples, genes, and compounds), here we explicitly examine *how* these components are organized into hierarchical structures and *how* information flows between them. By combining flow-based and hierarchical visualizations, we aim to reveal dominant routes of interaction, internal composition of key categories, and the structural context in which bioremediation-relevant functions operate.

### 6.1. What are the primary pathways of functional influence?

We first employ alluvial diagrams to visualize the flow of functional influence and interaction across different organizational levels of the system. These diagrams trace connections from high-level categories—such as regulatory agencies, chemical classes, or samples—down to specific genes and compounds. This can enable us to identify major routes by which regulatory priorities, sample capabilities, and molecular functions intersect. The impact of this analysis is a clear, intuitive mapping of where interactions concentrate, which categories act as main "bridges," and which entities emerge as recurrent transition points along the flow.

### 6.2. What is the internal composition of the most important functional and chemical categories?

To deepen this structural perspective, we then examine the internal composition of the system's most relevant functional and chemical categories. Treemaps are used to decompose broad classes—such as compound families or enzymatic groups—into their constituent elements and subcategories. This allows us to visualize heterogeneity within each category, identify where diversity is greatest, and highlight subclasses that contribute disproportionately to the overall functional potential. In doing so, we can provide a detailed compositional context for the major pathways of interaction identified in the alluvial diagrams.

### 6.3. How do flow-based and hierarchical views combine to support strategic interpretation?

Finally, we integrate the flow-based and hierarchical perspectives to support more informed, strategy-oriented interpretation. By overlaying key pathways of influence (from alluvial diagrams) with the internal structure of categories (from treemaps), we can pinpoint where influential flows intersect with highly diverse or enriched subgroups. This combined view can help to identify leverage points—for example, specific compound classes, functional modules, or sample groups—that are both structurally central and internally rich. Such points are natural candidates for prioritization in downstream analyses, experimental design, or the planning of bioremediation interventions.
