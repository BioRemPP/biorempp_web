## Our Laboratory

### Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Genomics (LBMG)

The Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Genomics (LBMG) at the **Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN)** began its work in 1996 with the establishment of the research base in Genetics and Molecular Biology.

In 2003, under the coordination of Professors **Lucymara Fassarella Agnez-Lima** and **Silvia Regina Batistuzzo de Medeiros**, a new laboratory was inaugurated, expanding its facilities.

The lab is affiliated with the **Department of Cell Biology and Genetics** at the **Biosciences Center of UFRN**. Today, LBMG brings together approximately **70 undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students**.
