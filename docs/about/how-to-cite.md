## Citing the BioRemPP Web Service

When using the **BioRemPP Web Service** for data exploration, analysis, or visualization in academic publications, please cite the platform as follows:

> **BioRemPP Web Service** — Bioremediation Potential Profile.
> An interactive web platform for integrative functional analysis of bioremediation-related data.
> Available at: *[WEB_SERVICE_URL]* (accessed on *[DD Month YYYY]*).

**Example (provisional format):**

```text
Author(s). BioRemPP Web Service: an interactive platform for bioremediation potential profiling. Year. Available at: [WEB_SERVICE_URL]
```

A finalized citation with journal reference and DOI will be provided upon formal publication of the associated web server article.

## Citing the BioRemPP Database

If your work relies on data derived from the **BioRemPP Database**, please cite the database explicitly, including the version used:

> **BioRemPP Database (version X.Y.Z)** — Curated enzyme–compound associations for bioremediation research.
> Released on: *[DD Month YYYY]*.
> License: CC BY 4.0.

**Example:**

```text
BioRemPP Database vX.Y.Z. Curated bioremediation enzyme–compound associations. Year. CC BY 4.0.
```

Always report the database version to ensure reproducibility.

## Citation Before DOI Assignment (Zenodo Deposit Pending)

Both the BioRemPP Web Service and the BioRemPP Database will be archived and assigned persistent identifiers via **Zenodo**. Until DOIs are issued, please use the provisional citation formats below and update references once the Zenodo records become available.

### Provisional Citation — Web Service

```text
Author(s). BioRemPP Web Service: Bioremediation Potential Profile. Year. Zenodo (DOI pending). Available at: [WEB_SERVICE_URL]
```

### Provisional Citation — Database

```text
Author(s). BioRemPP Database (version X.Y.Z): Curated enzyme–compound associations for bioremediation research. Year. Zenodo (DOI pending).
```

Once Zenodo DOIs are assigned, these provisional entries should be replaced with the corresponding DOI-based citations.
