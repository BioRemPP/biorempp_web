# UC-8.3: Compound-Specific KO Completeness Scorecard
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-8-3"

scientific_question: >
  For any given chemical compound, which biological sample possesses the most
  "complete" genetic toolkit (KO profile) for its biotransformation?

description: >
  This visualization provides a highly granular "scorecard" that ranks each
  sample's functional potential against every individual compound in the
  BioRemPP database. The analysis calculates a KO Completeness Score, which
  represents the percentage of all known KOs associated with a specific
  compound (within this dataset) that a particular sample possesses. The
  scorecard is presented as a heatmap matrix comparing Samples (rows) against
  individual Compound Names (columns), with cell values representing the
  completeness score (0-100%).

    description: >
      The visualization is structured as a matrix where rows represent individual
      biological samples (isolates/genomes) and columns represent specific
      chemical compounds from the BioRemPP database. Each cell in the matrix
      displays a completeness score as both color intensity and numerical value,
      creating an intuitive visual scorecard of compound-specific functional
      capabilities.
  
  - label: "Color Gradient (Green Scale)"
    description: >
      Cell colors range from light green (low completeness, 0-20%) through
      medium green (moderate completeness, 40-60%) to dark green (high
      completeness, 80-100%). The color intensity provides an immediate visual
      indicator of a sample's genetic toolkit completeness for each specific
      compound. Brighter/darker cells represent "hotspots" where a sample is
      an elite specialist for biotransforming that particular compound.
  
  - label: "Completeness Score Labels"
    description: >
      Each cell displays the completeness percentage (e.g., "85.5%") directly
      within the cell. A score of 100% indicates the sample possesses every
      single KO associated with that compound found in the entire dataset,
      making it a complete functional specialist for that specific pollutant.
      Scores below 50% may suggest the sample has an incomplete genetic toolkit
      for that compound.
  
  - label: "Sample Rows (Y-axis)"
    description: >
      Each row represents a biological sample and shows its completeness scores
      across all individual compounds. Reading across a row allows assessment
      of a sample's compound-specific capabilities. Multiple high scores (>70%)
      may indicate a multi-target specialist with broad compound coverage, while
      scattered high scores may suggest selective specialization for particular
      pollutants.
  
  - label: "Compound Columns (X-axis)"
    description: >
      Each column represents a specific chemical compound (individual pollutant)
      and shows completeness scores across all samples. Reading down a column
      can help identify which samples are best equipped for biotransforming that specific
      compound and may indicate the genetic complexity of its biotransformation
      pathway based on overall score distribution across all samples.

    Identifying Elite Specialists for Specific Targets: Brightly colored cells
    (dark green, >80% completeness) may identify a sample that is a potent
    "specialist" for biotransforming a specific compound. A score of 100% may indicate
    that the sample possesses every single KO associated with that compound in
    the entire dataset, suggesting it as a candidate for targeted biotransformation
    of that pollutant. These elite specialists may be prioritized for
    experimental validation and bioremediation applications targeting that
    specific contaminant.

    Profiling Sample Capabilities: Reading horizontally across a sample's row
    can help identify its detailed biotransformation profile. This can distinguish a
    "multi-target specialist" (a sample with high scores for several specific
    compounds) from a "niche specialist" (high score for only one or two
    compounds). Such profiling enables strategic sample selection based on
    contamination scenarios and can help identify versatile candidates versus
    highly specialized biological sources.
  
  - >
    Assessing Compound Biotransformation Complexity: Reading vertically down a
    compound column can help assess the genetic challenge posed by that specific
    compound. A compound with generally low scores across all samples (<50%
    average) may require a consortium of multiple biological sources, each contributing
    different parts of the necessary genetic toolkit, for its complete
    biotransformation. This may indicate a complex biotransformation pathway that is not
    fully encoded by any single biological source in the dataset.
  
  - >
    Strategic Sample Selection for Targeted Bioremediation: For single-compound
    contamination scenarios, select the sample with the highest completeness
    score for that specific compound (darkest cell in the column). For
    multi-compound contamination, evaluate samples with high scores across
    relevant compounds or design consortia combining complementary specialists
    to achieve comprehensive biotransformation coverage.

    Functional Gap Analysis and Pathway Engineering: Cells with low scores
    (<30%, light green) represent functional gaps where samples lack critical
    biotransformation genes for specific compounds. These gaps can guide genetic
    engineering efforts, horizontal gene transfer studies, or consortium
    design to achieve complete functional pathways. Identifying which specific
    KOs are missing for a given compound can inform targeted gene acquisition
    strategies or synthetic biology approaches.
