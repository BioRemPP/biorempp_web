scientific_question: >
  Which biological samples possess the most "complete" genetic toolkit for
  a given chemical class, and how can this be used to identify elite
  functional specialists?

description: >
  This visualization provides a quantitative "scorecard" that ranks each
  sample's functional potential for every compound class in the BioRemPP
  database. Instead of a simple presence/absence metric, this analysis
  calculates a Completeness Score. This score represents the percentage of
  all known KOs for a given compound class (within this dataset) that a
  specific sample possesses. The scorecard is presented as a heatmap matrix
  comparing Samples (rows) against Compound Classes (columns), with cell
  values representing the completeness score (0-100%).

  - label: "Heatmap Matrix"
    description: >
      The visualization is structured as a matrix where rows represent individual
      biological samples (isolates/genomes) and columns represent compound classes
      from the BioRemPP database. Each cell in the matrix displays a completeness
      score as both color intensity and numerical value, creating an intuitive
      visual scorecard of functional capabilities.
  
  - label: "Color Gradient (Green Scale)"
    description: >
      Cell colors range from light green (low completeness, 0-20%) through
      medium green (moderate completeness, 40-60%) to dark green (high
      completeness, 80-100%). The color intensity provides an immediate visual
      indicator of a sample's genetic toolkit completeness for each compound
      class. Brighter/darker cells represent "hotspots" of functional excellence.
  
  - label: "Completeness Score Labels"
    description: >
      Each cell displays the completeness percentage (e.g., "85.5%") directly
      within the cell. A score of 100% indicates the sample possesses every
      single KO for that compound class found in the entire dataset, making it
      a complete functional specialist. Scores below 50% may suggest incomplete
      genetic toolkits requiring consortium approaches.
  
  - label: "Sample Rows (Y-axis)"
    description: >
      Each row represents a biological sample and shows its completeness scores
      across all compound classes. Reading across a row allows assessment of a
      sample's versatility - multiple high scores (>70%) may indicate a generalist
      with broad capabilities, while scattered high scores may suggest
      selective specialization.
  
  - label: "Compound Class Columns (X-axis)"
    description: >
      Each column represents a chemical compound class (e.g., BTEX, PAHs,
      Chlorinated Solvents) and shows completeness scores across all samples.
      Reading down a column can help identify which samples are best equipped for that
      class and may indicate the complexity of the biotransformation pathway based
      on overall score distribution.

    Identifying Elite Specialists: Brightly colored cells (dark green, >80%
    completeness) may identify samples that are potent "specialists" for specific
    compound classes. A score of 100% may indicate the sample possesses every
    single KO for that class in the dataset, suggesting it as a candidate for
    targeted bioremediation of that chemical class. These elite specialists
    may be prioritized for experimental validation and application development.
  
  - >
    Comparing Functional Potential: Reading horizontally across a sample's row
    allows comprehensive assessment of its overall biotransformation capabilities.
    A sample with multiple high-scoring cells (>70%) may be a versatile candidate,
    potent across several different chemical classes. Such generalists are
    valuable for mixed contamination scenarios requiring broad functional coverage.
  
  - >
    Assessing Chemical Class Complexity: Reading vertically down a compound
    class column can help assess biotransformation difficulty. A class with generally low
    scores across all samples (<50% average) may indicate a complex biotransformation
    pathway that is not fully encoded by any single biological source. Such classes may
    require consortium approaches or pathway engineering to achieve complete
    biotransformation.
  
  - >
    Strategic Sample Selection: For bioremediation applications, select samples
    based on the contamination profile. For single-compound contamination, choose
    the sample with the highest completeness score for that class (darkest cell
    in column). For multi-compound contamination, select samples with high scores
    across relevant classes or combine complementary specialists to achieve
    comprehensive coverage.
  
  - >
    Functional Gap Analysis: Cells with low scores (<30%, light green) represent
    functional gaps where samples lack critical biotransformation genes. These gaps
    can guide genetic engineering efforts, horizontal gene transfer studies, or
    consortium design to achieve complete functional pathways. Identifying which
    specific KOs are missing can inform targeted gene acquisition strategies.
