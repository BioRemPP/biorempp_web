scientific_question: >
  Which biological samples possess the most "complete" genetic toolkit for
  a given KEGG metabolic pathway, and how can this be used to identify
  elite functional specialists?

description: >
  This visualization provides a quantitative "scorecard" that ranks each
  sample's functional potential for every metabolic pathway in the KEGG
  dataset. Instead of a simple presence/absence metric, this analysis
  calculates a Pathway Completeness Score. This score represents the
  percentage of all known KOs for a given pathway (within this dataset)
  that a specific sample possesses. The scorecard is presented as a heatmap
  matrix comparing Samples (rows) against KEGG Pathways (columns), with
  cell colors (without numerical labels) representing the completeness score
  gradient (0-100%).

  - label: "Heatmap Scorecard Matrix"
    description: >
      The visualization is structured as a matrix where rows represent individual
      biological samples (isolates/genomes) and columns represent KEGG metabolic
      pathways. Each cell's color intensity creates an intuitive visual scorecard
      of functional capabilities. Unlike other scorecards, this visualization uses
      only color gradients without displaying numerical values in the cells,
      emphasizing visual pattern recognition for comparative analysis.
  
  - label: "Color Gradient (Intensity Scale)"
    description: >
      Cell colors range from light tones (low completeness, 0-20%) through
      medium intensity (moderate completeness, 40-60%) to dark/saturated colors
      (high completeness, 80-100%). The color intensity provides an immediate
      visual indicator of a sample's genetic toolkit completeness for each KEGG
      pathway. Brighter/darker cells represent "hotspots" of functional excellence,
      enabling rapid identification of elite specialists through visual pattern
      recognition alone.
  
  - label: "Sample Rows (Y-axis)"
    description: >
      Each row represents a biological sample and shows its completeness profile
      across all KEGG pathways through color patterns. Reading across a row allows
      visual assessment of a sample's metabolic versatility - multiple dark cells
      may indicate a generalist with broad pathway coverage, while scattered dark cells
      may suggest selective specialization. The color-only approach facilitates rapid
      comparative scanning across multiple samples.
  
  - label: "KEGG Pathway Columns (X-axis)"
    description: >
      Each column represents a KEGG metabolic pathway (e.g., glycolysis, TCA cycle,
      amino acid biosynthesis) and shows completeness patterns across all samples
      through color distribution. Reading down a column      can help identify which samples are
      best equipped for that pathway and may indicate the complexity of the pathway
      based on overall color intensity distribution. Pathways with predominantly
      light colors may require consortium approaches.
  
  - label: "Interactive Hover Information"
    description: >
      While cell values are not displayed directly in the heatmap, hovering over
      any cell reveals detailed information including the exact completeness
      percentage, sample name, pathway name, and functional interpretation. This
      design balances clean visual presentation with access to precise quantitative
      data when needed, preventing visual clutter while maintaining analytical depth.

    Identifying Elite Specialists: Darkly colored cells (high intensity, representing
    >80% completeness) may identify samples that are potent "specialists" for specific
    KEGG pathways. A cell with maximum color intensity may indicate the sample possesses
    every single KO for that pathway in the dataset, suggesting it as a candidate for
    applications requiring that specific metabolic capability. These elite specialists
    may be prioritized for experimental validation and metabolic engineering efforts.

    Comparing Functional Potential: Reading horizontally across a sample's row allows
    comprehensive assessment of its overall metabolic capabilities through color
    patterns. A sample with multiple darkly colored cells may be a versatile "generalist,"
    potent across several different types of pathways. Such generalists are valuable
    for complex biotechnological applications requiring broad metabolic coverage.
    Conversely, samples with few dark cells may be highly specialized organisms.

    Assessing Pathway Complexity: Reading vertically down a pathway column can help assess
    metabolic pathway difficulty and distribution across samples. A pathway with
    generally light colors across all samples (<50% average completeness) may indicate
    a complex metabolic function that is not fully encoded by any single biological source
    in the dataset. Such pathways may require consortium approaches, metabolic
    engineering, or horizontal gene transfer to achieve complete functionality.

    Visual Pattern Recognition: The color-only design enables rapid identification
    of functional patterns without numerical distraction. Look for "hot rows"
    (samples with many dark cells = versatile generalists), "hot columns" (pathways
    with many dark cells = common/essential pathways), and "cold spots" (light cells
    = functional gaps or rare capabilities). These patterns guide strategic decisions
    for biotechnology applications and metabolic engineering targets.

    Strategic Sample and Pathway Selection: For metabolic engineering or synthetic
    biology applications, select samples based on the target pathway profile. For
    single-pathway applications, choose the sample with the darkest cell in that
    pathway's column (highest completeness). For multi-pathway applications, select
    samples with consistently dark cells across relevant pathways or design consortia
    combining complementary specialists. The visual clarity facilitates rapid
    decision-making in experimental design.
