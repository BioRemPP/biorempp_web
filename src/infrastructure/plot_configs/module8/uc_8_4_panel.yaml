scientific_question: >
  Which biological samples possess the most "complete" genetic toolkit for
  a given biotransformation pathway, and how can this be used to identify elite
  functional specialists?

description: >
  This visualization provides a quantitative "scorecard" that ranks each
  sample's functional potential for every compound pathway in the HADEG
  database. Instead of a simple presence/absence metric, this analysis
  calculates a Pathway Completeness Score. This score represents the
  percentage of all known KOs for a given pathway (within this dataset) that
  a specific sample possesses. The scorecard is presented as a heatmap matrix
  comparing Samples (rows) against Compound Pathways (columns), with cell
  values representing the completeness score (0-100%).

  - label: "Heatmap Matrix"
    description: >
      The visualization is structured as a matrix where rows represent individual
      biological samples (isolates/genomes) and columns represent compound
      pathways from the HADEG database. Each cell in the matrix displays a
      completeness score as both color intensity and numerical value, creating
      an intuitive visual scorecard of pathway-specific functional capabilities.
  
  - label: "Color Gradient (Green Scale)"
    description: >
      Cell colors range from light green (low completeness, 0-20%) through
      medium green (moderate completeness, 40-60%) to dark green (high
      completeness, 80-100%). The color intensity provides an immediate visual
      indicator of a sample's genetic toolkit completeness for each biotransformation
      pathway. Brighter/darker cells ("hotspots") may identify samples that are
      potent specialists for specific pathways.
  
  - label: "Completeness Score Labels"
    description: >
      Each cell displays the completeness percentage (e.g., "85.5%") directly
      within the cell. A score of 100% indicates the sample possesses every
      single KO for that pathway found in the entire dataset, making it a
      complete functional specialist. Scores below 50% may suggest incomplete
      genetic toolkits requiring consortium approaches or pathway engineering.
  
  - label: "Sample Rows (Y-axis)"
    description: >
      Each row represents a biological sample and shows its completeness scores
      across all HADEG pathways. Reading across a row allows assessment of a
      sample's versatility - multiple high scores (>70%) may indicate a generalist
      with broad pathway coverage, while scattered high scores may suggest
      selective specialization for particular biotransformation pathways.
  
  - label: "Pathway Columns (X-axis)"
    description: >
      Each column represents a compound biotransformation pathway from the HADEG
      database and shows completeness scores across all samples. Reading down
      a column can help identify which samples are best equipped for that pathway and
      may indicate the complexity of the biotransformation pathway based on overall
      score distribution across samples.

    Identifying Elite Specialists: Brightly colored cells (dark green, >80%
    completeness) may identify samples that are potent "specialists" for specific
    compound pathways. A score of 100% may indicate the sample possesses every
    single KO for that pathway in the dataset, suggesting it as a candidate for
    targeted bioremediation requiring that specific biotransformation pathway. These
    elite specialists may be prioritized for experimental validation and
    application development.

    Comparing Functional Potential: Reading horizontally across a sample's row
    allows comprehensive assessment of its overall biotransformation capabilities
    across different HADEG pathways. A sample with multiple high-scoring cells
    (>70%) may be a versatile candidate, potent across several different pathways.
    Such generalists are valuable for complex contamination scenarios requiring
    diverse functional coverage.
  
  - >
    Assessing Pathway Difficulty: Reading vertically down a pathway column
    can help assess biotransformation complexity. A pathway with generally low scores across
    all samples (<50% average) may indicate a complex biotransformation pathway that is
    not fully encoded by any single biological source. Such pathways may require
    consortium approaches combining multiple biological sources or pathway engineering
    to achieve complete biotransformation functionality.
  
  - >
    Strategic Sample Selection: For bioremediation applications targeting
    specific biotransformation pathways, select samples based on the pathway
    requirements. For single-pathway applications, choose the sample with the
    highest completeness score for that pathway (darkest cell in column). For
    multi-pathway scenarios, select samples with high scores across relevant
    pathways or combine complementary specialists to achieve comprehensive
    functional coverage.
  
  - >
    Functional Gap Analysis: Cells with low scores (<30%, light green) represent
    functional gaps where samples lack critical biotransformation genes for specific
    pathways. These gaps can guide genetic engineering efforts, horizontal gene
    transfer studies, or consortium design to achieve complete functional
    pathways. Identifying which specific KOs are missing can inform targeted
    gene acquisition strategies or synthetic biology approaches to complete
    incomplete biotransformation pathways.
