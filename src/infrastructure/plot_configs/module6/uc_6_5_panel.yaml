scientific_question: >
  For each class of chemical compounds, which enzymatic functions are most
  commonly employed, and which specific genes are the most versatile in
  targeting the widest range of substrates within that class?

description: >
  This visualization provides a hierarchical, top-down view of the functional
  landscape, starting from broad chemical classes. The treemap illustrates how
  these classes are targeted by different enzymatic activities, which are in
  turn carried out by specific genes. The size of each rectangle is proportional
  to the number of unique compounds targeted, highlighting the functions and
  genes with the broadest substrate scope. The nested rectangles represent the
  hierarchical path: Compound Class -> Enzyme Activity -> Gene Symbol.

  - label: "Nested Rectangles (Hierarchy)"
    description: >
      The chart uses nested rectangles to represent the hierarchy. The largest
      rectangles represent the top-level categories (Compound Class), containing
      smaller rectangles for Enzyme Activity, which in turn contain the smallest
      rectangles for Gene Symbol.

  - label: "Area (Values)"
    description: >
      The area of each rectangle is proportional to the total unique compound
      count for that category and all categories nested within it. Larger areas
      indicate a broader substrate scope and more versatile biotransformation capacity.

  - label: "Color Scale (Greens)"
    description: >
      The color of each rectangle corresponds to its unique compound count,
      with darker/more intense greens indicating higher values. This provides
      immediate visual identification of the most versatile categories.

  - label: "Interactive Zoom"
    description: >
      Click on any rectangle to zoom in and explore that specific branch of
      the hierarchy in more detail. Click the header bar to zoom out and
      return to the previous level.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over each rectangle displays the category name and its exact
      unique compound count value.

    Chemical Class Importance: The largest rectangles at the top level represent
    the compound classes that are targeted by the most versatile enzymatic
    machinery, indicating classes with the broadest degradation support.

  - >
    Dominant Enzymatic Functions: Within a given compound class, the largest
    Enzyme Activity rectangles can help identify which enzymatic functions are most
    promiscuous in terms of the number of different compounds they can process.

  - >
    Key Genetic Contributors: At the lowest level, the largest Gene Symbol
    rectangles represent the most versatile genes within each enzyme-class
    combination. These are prime candidates for biotechnological applications.

  - >
    Cross-Class Versatility: Genes that appear prominently across multiple
    compound classes may represent broadly useful degradation machinery with
    potential for engineered bioremediation solutions.

  - >
    Hierarchical Patterns: The overall structure can help identify how biotransformation
    capacity is distributed across the functional landscape, helping assess
    which branches are most promiscuous and valuable.
