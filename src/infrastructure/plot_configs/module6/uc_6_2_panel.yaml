scientific_question: >
  How is the functional potential of each microbial sample distributed across
  different chemical classes, and which enzymatic activities are predominantly
  employed for each?

description: >
  This alluvial diagram visualizes the biological flow of interactions across
  three distinct stages: from the source sample, through the chemical class it
  targets, to the specific enzymatic function used. The width of the flows
  represents the number of observed interactions, providing a quantitative map
  of the dominant metabolic strategies for each organism.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Stages (Vertical Columns)"
    description: >
      The three vertical columns represent the hierarchical flow of biological
      interactions: Sample, Compound Class, and Enzyme Activity. Each column
      represents a distinct level in the metabolic process.

  - label: "Nodes"
    description: >
      Each node represents a unique entity at its respective stage. From left
      to right: microbial samples, chemical compound classes, and enzymatic
      activities. Node size reflects the total flow passing through it.

  - label: "Flows (Ribbons)"
    description: >
      The ribbons connecting nodes represent the flow of interactions between
      stages. Each flow traces a pathway from a sample through the compound
      class it targets to the enzymatic function employed.

  - label: "Flow Thickness"
    description: >
      The thickness of a flow is proportional to the number of interactions
      it represents. Thicker flows indicate more dominant or frequently
      observed metabolic pathways in the dataset.

  - label: "Interactivity"
    description: >
      Hover over nodes and flows to see their names and values. Nodes can
      be dragged vertically to improve readability and explore specific
      pathways of interest.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Dominant Metabolic Strategies: The thickest flows can help identify the primary
    metabolic strategies employed by the biological community, showing which
    compound classes are most frequently targeted by which enzyme activities.

  - >
    Sample Specialization: A sample with a few thick, dominant flows can be
    considered a "specialist." An organism whose flow branches out to many
    different classes and activities is a functional "generalist."

  - >
    Enzyme Versatility: An enzyme activity node that receives flows from
    many different compound classes can be interpreted as a versatile or
    broadly applicable function within the consortium.

  - >
    Chemical Class Coverage: Identify which compound classes receive the
    most attention from the consortium and which may represent gaps in
    the bioremediation potential.

  - >
    Consortium Optimization: Use this visualization to identify redundant
    capabilities or gaps that could inform the design of optimized
    microbial consortia for specific bioremediation targets.
