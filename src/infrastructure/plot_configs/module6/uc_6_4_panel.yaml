scientific_question: >
  Which enzymatic functions are the most versatile (i.e., target the widest
  range of unique compounds), how is this versatility distributed across
  different chemical classes, and which specific genes are the primary
  drivers of these activities?

description: >
  This visualization provides a hierarchical, top-down view of the functional
  landscape of the enzymatic activities. The treemap illustrates how broad
  enzyme functions are composed of activities targeting specific chemical
  classes, which are in turn carried out by individual genes. The size of
  each rectangle is proportional to the number of unique compounds associated
  with it, highlighting the most promiscuous and important enzymatic functions.
  The nested rectangles represent the hierarchical path: Enzyme Activity ->
  Compound Class -> Gene Symbol.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Nested Rectangles (Hierarchy)"
    description: >
      The chart uses nested rectangles to represent the hierarchy. The largest
      rectangles represent the top-level categories (Enzyme Activity),
      containing smaller rectangles for Compound Class, which in turn contain
      the smallest rectangles for Gene Symbol.

  - label: "Area (Values)"
    description: >
      The area of each rectangle is proportional to the total unique compound
      count for that category and all categories nested within it. Larger
      areas indicate a broader substrate scope and more versatile functions.

  - label: "Color Scale (Greens)"
    description: >
      The color of each rectangle corresponds to its unique compound count,
      with darker/more intense greens indicating higher values. This provides
      immediate visual identification of the most promiscuous enzymatic
      activities.

  - label: "Interactive Zoom"
    description: >
      Click on any rectangle to zoom in and explore that specific branch
      of the hierarchy in more detail. Click the header bar to zoom out
      and return to the previous level.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over each rectangle displays the category name and its
      exact unique compound count value.

    Most Versatile Enzyme Functions: The largest rectangles at the top level
    (e.g., oxidoreductase, transferase) represent the most versatile enzymatic
    functions that target the widest range of different chemical compounds.
    These are key functional categories for broad bioremediation potential.

  - >
    Substrate Specificity: Within a given enzyme activity, the largest
    Compound Class rectangles can help identify its primary chemical targets. For
    example, this can show if a hydrolase function is primarily focused
    on biotransforming aromatic compounds versus aliphatic compounds.

  - >
    Key Genetic Contributors: At the lowest level, the largest Gene Symbol
    rectangles represent the key powerhouse genes that are responsible for
    the broadest substrate activity within their functional and chemical
    context. These genes may be targets for bioremediation applications.

  - >
    Functional Promiscuity: Enzyme activities with uniformly distributed
    compound classes may suggest broad-spectrum biotransformation capability, while
    those dominated by a single class may indicate specialized function.

  - >
    Hierarchical Patterns: The overall structure can help identify how enzymatic
    versatility is distributed across the functional landscape, helping assess
    which branches are most promiscuous and valuable.
