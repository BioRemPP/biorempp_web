scientific_question: >
  Which chemical classes and specific compounds require the most diverse
  genetic toolkit for their degradation, and which microbial samples are
  the primary contributors to this diversity?

description: >
  This visualization provides a hierarchical, top-down view of the genetic
  investment in bioremediation. The treemap illustrates how broad chemical
  classes are composed of specific compounds, which are in turn targeted
  by different microbial samples. The size of each rectangle is proportional
  to the number of unique genes involved, highlighting the most genetically
  complex interactions. The nested rectangles represent the hierarchical
  path: Compound Class -> Compound Name -> Sample.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Nested Rectangles"
    description: >
      The chart uses nested rectangles to represent the hierarchy. The largest
      rectangles represent the top-level categories (Compound Class), with
      smaller nested rectangles for Compound Name and Sample levels.

  - label: "Area (Values)"
    description: >
      The area of each rectangle is proportional to the total unique gene
      count for that category and all categories nested within it. Larger
      areas indicate greater genetic diversity.

  - label: "Color"
    description: >
      The color of each rectangle corresponds to its unique gene count,
      with brighter/warmer green tones indicating a higher value. This
      provides an additional visual cue for identifying genetically
      demanding categories.

  - label: "Interactivity"
    description: >
      You can click on any rectangle to zoom in and explore that specific
      branch of the hierarchy in more detail. Click outside or use the
      breadcrumb to navigate back.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over each rectangle displays the category name and its
      exact unique gene count value.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Genetically Demanding Chemical Classes: The largest rectangles at the
    top level represent the compound class categories that are associated
    with the most diverse set of degradation genes across the entire dataset.

  - >
    Complex Compounds: Within a given class, the largest compound name
    rectangles represent the specific pollutants that appear to require
    the most complex or varied genetic toolkit for their degradation.

  - >
    Key Microbial Players: At the lowest level, the largest sample
    rectangles pinpoint the specific organisms that contribute the most
    genetic diversity to the degradation of a particular compound.

  - >
    Hierarchical Patterns: The overall structure can help identify how genetic
    diversity is distributed across the functional landscape, helping assess
    which branches are most genetically diverse and valuable.

  - >
    Consortium Design: Samples that appear prominently across multiple
    compounds may be good candidates for bioremediation consortia.
