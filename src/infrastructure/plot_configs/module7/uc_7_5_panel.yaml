# UC-7.5: Interactive Distribution of Toxicity Scores by Endpoint
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-7-5"

scientific_question: >
  Within a broad toxicological domain (e.g., Genomic Toxicity), what are the
  probability distributions of predicted toxicity scores across its specific
  endpoints, and which endpoints exhibit the highest median risk or greatest
  variability?

description: >
  This interactive visualization allows for the detailed exploration of the
  predicted toxicity scores from the ToxCSM dataset. By selecting a high-level
  toxicity category from the dropdown menu, the plot dynamically updates to
  display a series of overlaid kernel density estimate (KDE) curves. Each curve
  represents the distribution of toxicity scores for a specific toxicological
  endpoint within that category, allowing for direct comparison of their shapes,
  peaks, and spreads.

  - label: "Dropdown Menu"
    description: >
      Use this to select the Toxicity Super-Category (e.g., Genomic, Environmental)
      to analyze. The plot will update automatically.

  - label: "X-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the predicted Toxicity Score, typically ranging from 0 (low risk)
      to 1 (high risk).

  - label: "Y-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the Probability Density. The area under each curve sums to 1.

  - label: "Overlaid Curves"
    description: >
      Each colored, semi-transparent curve represents the distribution of scores
      for a single Toxicological Endpoint. The legend identifies which color
      corresponds to which endpoint.

    Identifying High-Risk Endpoints: The position of the peaks (modes) of the
    curves reveals where the scores are most concentrated. A curve with a peak
    shifted to the right (towards 1.0) indicates an endpoint where high toxicity
    scores are more common.

  - >
    Assessing Consensus vs. Variability: A tall, narrow peak indicates a strong
    consensus in the predicted scores for an endpoint (low variability). A short,
    wide curve indicates high variability, where compounds have a wide range of
    predicted toxic effects.

  - >
    Comparative Toxicology: The plot allows for direct comparison of risk profiles.
    By observing the shapes and positions of the overlaid curves, one can quickly
    assess which endpoints are generally of higher concern or have more unpredictable
    outcomes within a given toxicological category.
