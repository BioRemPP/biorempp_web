# UC-7.7: Sample Risk Mitigation Depth Profile by Genetic Investment
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-7-7"

scientific_question: >
  Which biological samples invest the most significant genetic resources
  (number of gene-compound interactions) in mitigating high-risk compounds?

description: >
  This visualization creates a "Risk Mitigation Depth Profile" for each sample.
  In contrast to measuring the variety of compounds, this treemap quantifies
  the depth or intensity of the functional response. The size of each rectangle
  is proportional to the total number of gene-compound interactions, highlighting
  where each sample focuses its genetic machinery against high-risk compounds.
  The hierarchy follows: Sample -> Toxicity Category -> Compound Name.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Nested Rectangles (Hierarchy)"
    description: >
      The chart uses nested rectangles to represent the hierarchy. The largest
      rectangles represent the top-level categories (Sample). Within each sample,
      rectangles represent Toxicity Categories, and within those, individual
      Compound Names.

  - label: "Rectangle Area (Values)"
    description: >
      The area of each rectangle is proportional to the total number of
      gene-compound interactions, which serves as a proxy for the genetic
      investment in mitigating risk. Larger areas indicate deeper genetic response.

  - label: "Color (Toxicity Category)"
    description: >
      The color of the second-level rectangles identifies the Toxicity Category
      (e.g., Genomic, Environmental, Nuclear Response), allowing for easy visual
      grouping across samples.

  - label: "Interactivity"
    description: >
      You can click on any rectangle to "zoom in" and explore that specific
      branch of the hierarchy in more detail. Click outside to zoom back out.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    High Genetic Investment: Large rectangles represent a significant genetic
    investment from a sample towards a specific risk category or compound. This
    may indicate a deep, multi-gene response.

  - >
    Sample Specialization: By observing the second level of the hierarchy, one
    can help identify a sample's specialization. A sample with a large rectangle for
    the "High Predicted Risk" category may be investing heavily in mitigating
    the most hazardous compounds.

  - >
    Complex Targets: A compound that forms a large rectangle may suggest it is a
    complex target that requires a diverse, multi-gene response for its
    biotransformation.

  - >
    Consortium Design: Combine samples with complementary depth profiles -
    one with deep genetic investment in "Environmental" toxins and another
    in "Genomic" toxins - to create a robust remediation consortium.
