# UC-7.6: Sample Risk Mitigation Breadth by Compound Variety
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-7-6"

scientific_question: >
  Which biological samples possess the broadest capability to mitigate risk,
  as measured by the diversity of high-risk compounds they can target
  within each toxicological category?

description: >
  This visualization creates a "Risk Mitigation Breadth Profile" for each sample.
  In contrast to measuring the depth of genetic investment, this treemap quantifies
  the variety of compounds a sample can handle. The size of each rectangle is
  proportional to the number of unique high-risk compounds a sample interacts with
  for a given toxicological category. The hierarchy follows: Sample -> Toxicity Category.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Nested Rectangles (Hierarchy)"
    description: >
      The chart uses nested rectangles to represent the hierarchy. The largest
      rectangles represent the top-level categories (Sample). Within each sample,
      smaller rectangles represent the Toxicity Categories.

  - label: "Rectangle Area (Values)"
    description: >
      The area of each rectangle is proportional to the count of unique high-risk
      compounds targeted by that sample within that category. Larger areas indicate
      a broader mitigation capability.

  - label: "Color (Toxicity Category)"
    description: >
      The color of the second-level rectangles identifies the Toxicity Category
      (e.g., Genomic, Environmental, Nuclear Response, Stress Response, Organic).

  - label: "Interactivity"
    description: >
      You can click on any rectangle to "zoom in" and explore that specific branch
      of the hierarchy. Click outside to zoom back out.

    Versatile Generalists: Samples with the largest overall area are the most
    versatile "generalists," capable of targeting the widest variety of high-risk
    compounds across all categories.

  - >
    Category Specialists: By examining the second level of the hierarchy, one can
    can help identify a sample's specialization. A sample with a large rectangle for the
    "High Predicted Risk" category may be a specialist in mitigating the most
    hazardous compounds.

    Complementary Consortium Design: This view is ideal for designing a consortium
    with maximum chemical coverage. One would select Sample A for its broad coverage
    of "Genomic" toxins and combine it with Sample B for its broad coverage of
    "Organic" toxins to create a team that can handle the widest possible range
    of threats.

  - >
    Risk Prioritization: The relative sizes of toxicity categories within a sample
    can help reveal which types of risks that sample is best suited to mitigate, enabling
    strategic selection for specific remediation scenarios.
