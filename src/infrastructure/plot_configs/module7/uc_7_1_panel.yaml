# UC-7.1: Faceted Heatmap of Predicted Compound Toxicity Profiles
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-7-1"

scientific_question: >
  What is the comprehensive toxicological profile of each chemical compound
  across a wide range of risk categories, and which compounds pose the most
  significant and multi-faceted hazards?

description: >
  This visualization provides a detailed toxicological fingerprint for each
  compound analyzed by the ToxCSM model. The faceted heatmap displays the
  predicted toxicity scores for each compound across numerous endpoints,
  which are grouped into five major super-categories. This allows for a
  direct comparison of the specific risks associated with each chemical.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Facets (Subplots)"
    description: >
      Each of the five subplots represents a major Toxicity Category:
      Nuclear Response, Stress Response, Genomic, Environmental, and Organic.
      This faceted layout allows for organized comparison across different
      toxicological domains.

  - label: "Y-Axis (Compound Names)"
    description: >
      Represents the individual Compound Names being analyzed. Each row
      corresponds to a unique chemical compound from the dataset, allowing
      the assessment of its complete toxicological profile across all
      endpoints.

  - label: "X-Axis (Toxicological Endpoints)"
    description: >
      Represents the specific Toxicological Endpoints within each category.
      Different facets may have different numbers of endpoints depending on
      the available assays and predictions for that toxicity domain.

  - label: "Cell Color (Toxicity Score)"
    description: >
      The color intensity of each cell indicates the predicted Toxicity Score,
      typically ranging from 0 to 1. Darker, warmer colors (reds) indicate a
      higher predicted risk, while lighter colors indicate lower risk.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over a cell reveals the compound name, the specific endpoint,
      the predicted numerical score, and its corresponding qualitative label
      (e.g., 'High Toxicity', 'Moderate Risk').

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Compound Risk Fingerprint: By reading across a horizontal row, one can
    assess the complete toxicological "fingerprint" of a single compound.
    This can be useful for identifying compounds that pose multiple, distinct
    types of risk (e.g., a compound that is both carcinogenic and an
    environmental toxin).

  - >
    High-Concern Endpoints: Vertical columns that are consistently dark across
    many compounds represent toxicological endpoints that are a common
    predicted outcome for the chemicals in this dataset. These endpoints
    may warrant prioritized attention in remediation strategies.

  - >
    Prioritizing "Problem" Compounds: Compounds with numerous dark red cells,
    especially across multiple facets, may be identified as the most hazardous
    pollutants. This allows for the prioritization of these specific chemicals
    for targeted bioremediation strategies.

  - >
    Category-Specific Patterns: Comparing patterns across the five facets
    helps understand if certain compounds are specialists (toxic in one
    domain) or generalists (toxic across multiple domains), informing
    risk assessment strategies.

  - >
    Identifying Safe Compounds: Compounds with predominantly light-colored
    cells across all facets may be considered lower priority for immediate
    remediation efforts, allowing resources to be focused on higher-risk
    chemicals.
