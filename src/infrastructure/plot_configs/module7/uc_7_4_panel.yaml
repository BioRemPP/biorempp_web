# UC-7.4: Toxicity Score Distribution by Endpoint Category
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-7-4"

scientific_question: >
  Within a broad toxicological domain (e.g., Genomic Toxicity), what is the
  statistical distribution of predicted toxicity scores across its specific
  endpoints, and which endpoints exhibit the highest median risk or greatest
  variability?

description: >
  This interactive visualization allows for the detailed exploration of the
  predicted toxicity scores from the ToxCSM dataset. By selecting a high-level
  toxicity category from the dropdown menu, the plot dynamically updates to
  display a series of box plots. Each box plot summarizes the distribution of
  toxicity scores for a specific toxicological endpoint within that category,
  allowing for direct comparison.

    description: >
      Use this to select the Toxicity Super-Category (e.g., Genomic,
      Environmental) to analyze. The plot will update automatically.
  
  - label: "X-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the individual Toxicological Endpoints within the selected
      super-category.
  
  - label: "Y-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the predicted Toxicity Score, typically ranging from 0
      (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  
  - label: "Box Plot"
    description: >
      Each box summarizes the distribution of scores for all compounds for
      that endpoint, showing the median, quartiles, and range.
  
  - label: "Points"
    description: >
      The individual points represent the toxicity scores for specific
      compounds.

    Identifying High-Risk Endpoints: Endpoints with box plots positioned
    higher on the y-axis (i.e., with a high median score) represent areas
    of greater overall toxicological concern.
  
  - >
    Assessing Variability: The height of a box (the interquartile range)
    indicates the variability in toxicity scores for that endpoint. A tall
    box signifies a wide range of predicted effects, while a short box
    indicates that most compounds have a similar predicted score.
  
  - >
    Spotting Potent Compounds: Individual points that are outliers (far
    above the main box) represent specific compounds with exceptionally high
    predicted toxicity for that endpoint, making them key targets for further
    investigation.
  
  - >
    Comparative Toxicology: The plot allows for a direct comparison of risk
    profiles. For instance, one can quickly assess whether Carcinogenesis
    scores are generally higher or more variable than AMES_Mutagenesis scores
    within the "Genomic" category.
