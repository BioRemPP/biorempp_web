# UC-1.3: Proportional Contribution of References
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-1-3"

scientific_question: >
  What is the relative contribution of each regulatory agency's associated
  functional potential to the total unique KO diversity observed across the
  entire dataset?

description: >
  This visualization provides a high-level overview of the functional landscape
  by breaking down the complete set of unique KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers
  by the regulatory context in which they appear. The 100% stacked bar chart
  illustrates the proportional contribution of each reference agency to the total
  pool of unique KOs identified. The primary entities compared are the regulatory
  or scientific agencies (e.g., WFD, CONAMA, EPC) that provide a contextual basis
  for the importance of certain compounds.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Single Stacked Bar"
    description: >
      The chart consists of a single vertical bar that represents the entirety
      (100%) of the unique KOs found in the dataset. This single-bar format
      emphasizes the proportional breakdown rather than absolute counts,
      allowing for immediate visual comparison of relative contributions.
  
  - label: "Colored Segments"
    description: >
      Each colored segment within the bar corresponds to a specific Reference
      Agency (e.g., WFD, CONAMA, EPC). Different colors help distinguish between
      agencies and make it easy to identify which regulatory contexts are
      associated with the most functionally diverse chemical spaces.
  
  - label: "Segment Length and Percentage Labels"
    description: >
      The length of each segment, along with its percentage label (e.g., "30.5%"),
      indicates that agency's proportional contribution to the total unique KO
      pool. Larger segments represent agencies whose associated compounds are
      linked to greater metabolic functional diversity. The percentages sum to
      exactly 100%.
  
  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over any segment reveals detailed information including the
      Reference Agency name, the exact count of unique KOs associated with that
      agency, and the percentage share. This provides precise quantification
      while maintaining the visual clarity of the proportional view.
  
  - label: "Legend"
    description: >
      The legend on the right side lists all Reference Agencies with their
      corresponding colors. This allows quick identification of which segment
      represents which regulatory context without needing to hover over each
      segment.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Dominant Contributions: Larger segments highlight the regulatory agencies
    whose associated compounds are linked to the greatest diversity of metabolic
    functions (KOs) within this dataset. This may indicate which agencies'
    regulations cover the most functionally diverse or well-represented chemical
    spaces, potentially reflecting broader regulatory scope or more comprehensive
    compound lists.
  
  - >
    Specialized Scope: Smaller segments may represent agencies with a more
    specialized focus, whose target compounds are associated with a narrower
    or less common set of metabolic pathways. For example, an agency focused
    solely on pesticides might have fewer associated KOs than one regulating
    general water quality.

    Comparative Overview: The chart allows for a rapid, at-a-glance comparison
    of the functional breadth associated with each regulatory context. Researchers
    can quickly identify which agencies' compound lists contribute most to the
    overall functional diversity of the dataset and which represent more niche
    or specialized regulatory domains.
  
  - >
    Functional Coverage Balance: By examining the distribution of percentages,
    researchers can assess whether the functional diversity is evenly distributed
    across regulatory contexts or concentrated in a few dominant agencies. A
    balanced distribution may suggest complementary regulatory frameworks, while
    concentration may indicate that certain agencies drive the functional landscape.
  
  - >
    Research Priority Guidance: Agencies with larger proportional contributions
    may warrant prioritized attention in bioremediation research, as their
    regulated compounds are associated with a broader range of metabolic
    capabilities. Conversely, agencies with smaller but unique contributions
    may offer specialized insights into specific functional niches.
