# UC-1.4: Proportional Functional Diversity of Biological Samples
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-1-4"

scientific_question: >
  What is the relative functional diversity of each biological sample 
  in comparison to the entire observed functional landscape?

description: >
  This visualization provides a high-level overview of the functional potential
  of each biological sample by breaking down the complete set of unique KEGG
  Orthology (KO) identifiers by sample. The 100% stacked bar chart illustrates
  the proportional contribution of each sample to the total pool of unique KOs
  identified. The primary entities compared are the biological samples that
  provide insight into the functional richness and metabolic versatility of
  different biological sources.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Single Stacked Bar"
    description: >
      The chart consists of a single vertical bar that represents the entirety
      (100%) of the unique KOs found in the dataset. This single-bar format
      emphasizes the proportional breakdown rather than absolute counts,
      allowing for immediate visual comparison of relative functional contributions.
  
  - label: "Colored Segments"
    description: >
      Each colored segment within the bar corresponds to a specific biological
      sample. Different colors help distinguish between samples and make it easy
      to identify which biological sources are associated with the most
      functionally diverse metabolic capabilities.
  
  - label: "Segment Length and Percentage Labels"
    description: >
      The length of each segment, along with its percentage label (e.g., "23.4%"),
      indicates that sample's proportional contribution to the total unique KO
      pool. Larger segments represent samples with greater metabolic functional
      diversity. The percentages sum to exactly 100%.
  
  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over any segment reveals detailed information including the
      sample name, the exact count of unique KOs associated with that sample,
      and the percentage share. This provides precise quantification while
      maintaining the visual clarity of the proportional view.
  
  - label: "Legend"
    description: >
      The legend on the right side lists all samples with their corresponding
      colors. This allows quick identification of which segment represents which
      biological source without needing to hover over each segment.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Functional Richness: Larger segments highlight the biological samples with
    the greatest diversity of metabolic functions (KOs) within this dataset.
    These are the most functionally rich or versatile biological sources, with
    segments >20% indicating broad metabolic capabilities spanning diverse
    pathways. Such biological sources are candidates for remediation strategies
    or functional annotation studies.
  
  - >
    Comparative Diversity: The chart allows for a rapid, at-a-glance comparison
    of the functional breadth of each sample. A sample with a significantly
    larger segment possesses a more diverse array of unique metabolic functions
    compared to others. This visual comparison can help researchers identify
    functionally rich biological sources versus specialists.
  
  - >
    Niche Specialization: Smaller segments (typically <5%) may represent samples
    with a more specialized focus, possessing a narrower set of metabolic
    capabilities. These biological sources might excel in specific environmental
    niches or biotransformation pathways rather than broad functional versatility.
    They can be valuable for targeted applications in specific remediation contexts.
  
  - >
    Functional Coverage Balance: By examining the distribution of percentages,
    researchers can assess whether the functional diversity is evenly distributed
    across samples (multiple samples with 10-20% each suggesting complementary
    functional roles) or concentrated in a few dominant biological sources (one
    sample >50% indicating a single functional powerhouse with others providing
    niche coverage).
  
  - >
    Research Prioritization: Samples with larger proportional contributions
    may be prioritized for in-depth functional annotation, pathway reconstruction,
    and experimental validation. Their broad functional repertoire makes them
    potentially valuable for understanding comprehensive biotransformation or
    remediation mechanisms. Specialized samples (smaller segments) may offer
    unique insights into specific functional niches.
