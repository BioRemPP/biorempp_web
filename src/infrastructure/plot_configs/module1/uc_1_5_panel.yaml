# UC-1.5: Regulatory Reference Compliance Scorecard

use_case_id: "uc-1-5"

scientific_question: >
  How "compliant" is the functional potential of each biological sample with
  the priorities of different regulatory bodies, as measured by the percentage
  of monitored compounds they can target?

description: >
  This visualization provides a practical, application-oriented "scorecard"
  that quantifies how well each sample's degradation capabilities align with
  the priorities of major regulatory agencies. The heatmap displays a calculated
  Compliance Score, which represents the percentage of an agency's target
  compounds that a sample is equipped to interact with. The scorecard is
  presented as a heatmap matrix comparing Samples (rows) against Regulatory
  Agencies (columns), with cell values representing the compliance score (0-100%).

      The visualization is structured as a matrix where rows represent individual
      biological samples and columns represent different regulatory agencies
      (e.g., EPA, EPC, ATSDR). Each cell in the matrix displays a compliance
      score as both color intensity and numerical value, creating an intuitive
      visual scorecard of regulatory alignment and application readiness.
  
  - label: "Color Gradient (Blue Scale)"
    description: >
      Cell colors range from light blue (low compliance, 0-20%) through
      medium blue (moderate compliance, 40-60%) to dark blue (high compliance,
      80-100%). The color intensity provides an immediate visual indicator of
      a sample's alignment with each agency's priorities. Brighter/darker cells
      represent "hotspots" of regulatory compliance excellence, identifying
      samples with strong application potential for specific regulatory contexts.
  
  - label: "Compliance Score Labels"
    description: >
      Each cell displays the compliance percentage (e.g., "95.0%") directly
      within the cell. A score of 100% indicates the sample can target every
      single compound monitored by that agency, making it a comprehensive
      solution for that regulatory framework. Scores above 80% suggest strong
      alignment and application readiness for agency-specific bioremediation.
  
  - label: "Sample Rows (Y-axis)"
    description: >
      Each row represents a biological sample and shows its compliance scores
      across all regulatory agencies. Reading across a row allows assessment
      of a sample's regulatory versatility - multiple high scores (>70%)
      indicate a broad-spectrum regulatory compliance profile, while selective
      high scores suggest specialization for specific agency priorities.
  
  - label: "Regulatory Agency Columns (X-axis)"
    description: >
      Each column represents a regulatory agency (e.g., EPA, EPC, ATSDR) and
      shows compliance scores across all samples. Reading down a column reveals
      which samples are best equipped for that agency's environmental standards
      and can indicate the feasibility of achieving comprehensive compliance
      with available biological resources.

    Identifying High-Compliance Specialists: Brightly colored cells (dark blue,
    >80% compliance) identify samples that may be potent "specialists" for specific
    regulatory contexts. A score of 95% for Sample A and the EPA means Sample A
    can target 95% of the EPA's priority pollutants, suggesting it as a candidate
    for EPA-focused bioremediation applications. These high-compliance specialists
    may be prioritized for regulatory approval pathways and field deployment.

    Discovering Versatile Generalists: A sample with consistently high scores
    across multiple agency columns (>70% across all agencies) may be a functional
    "generalist" with broad regulatory relevance. Such samples can be valuable
    for multi-jurisdictional applications or contamination scenarios that must
    meet multiple regulatory standards simultaneously.
  
  - >
    Consortium Design for Regulatory Compliance: To achieve comprehensive
    compliance across all relevant agencies, select a combination of samples
    that together achieve high scores across all agency columns. For example,
    if Sample A scores 90% for EPA but 40% for ATSDR, while Sample B scores
    50% for EPA but 95% for ATSDR, combining them creates a consortium with
    broad regulatory coverage.
  
  - >
    Strategic Sample Selection: For regulatory-driven bioremediation projects,
    samples may be selected based on the governing agency's standards. For EPA-
    regulated sites, consider choosing the sample with the highest compliance score
    for EPA (darkest cell in EPA column). For sites under multiple jurisdictions,
    samples with balanced high scores or complementary consortia may be explored.

    Compliance Gap Analysis: Cells with low scores (<30%, light blue) represent
    compliance gaps where samples lack the functional capacity to address
    agency priorities. These gaps can guide research priorities, bioprospecting
    efforts, or genetic engineering strategies to develop samples with better
    regulatory alignment. Identifying which specific compounds are missing can
    inform targeted capability enhancement.
