# UC-1.6: Sample-Agency Functional Potential Heatmap
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-1-6"

scientific_question: >
  To what extent does the functional potential, measured by unique KO diversity,
  of different samples align with the priorities of various environmental
  regulatory agencies?

description: >
  This heatmap visualizes the distribution of functional potential across
  biological samples within different regulatory contexts. It quantifies the
  number of unique KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers at the intersection of
  each sample and reference agency, providing a matrix of functional relevance.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Y-Axis (Reference Agencies)"
    description: >
      Represents the different Reference Agencies (e.g., WFD, CONAMA, EPA).
      Each row corresponds to a distinct regulatory framework with its own
      set of monitored compounds and environmental priorities.

  - label: "X-Axis (Samples)"
    description: >
      Represents the individual biological samples in the dataset. Each column
      corresponds to a unique sample with its own functional gene repertoire.

  - label: "Cell Color and Values"
    description: >
      The color intensity of each cell (and the number within it) indicates
      the count of unique KOs found for that specific Sample-Agency combination.
      The color bar on the right provides the quantitative scale. Darker/brighter
      colors indicate higher KO counts, representing stronger functional potential.

  - label: "Color Bar"
    description: >
      Located on the right side of the heatmap, it provides a quantitative
      reference for interpreting cell colors. Values range from the minimum
      to the maximum unique KO count across all Sample-Agency combinations.

  - >
    Functional Hotspots: Brightly colored cells ("hotspots") may identify a strong
    alignment between a sample's functional capabilities and a specific agency's
    focus, suggesting potential relevance for interacting with compounds monitored
    by that agency. These samples may be candidates for targeted bioremediation
    applications.

  - >
    Agency-Level Patterns: Rows with consistently high values may indicate that
    an agency's target compounds are associated with widely distributed metabolic
    functions. This may suggest that the monitored compounds require common
    enzymatic pathways present across multiple samples.

  - >
    Sample-Level Profiles: Columns with consistently high values may suggest a
    functional "generalist" sample with broad metabolic potential capable of
    addressing multiple regulatory concerns. Conversely, a sample with hotspots
    in only one or two rows could be considered a "specialist" with targeted
    capabilities.

  - >
    Regulatory Coverage Assessment: By comparing values across rows, researchers
    can identify which regulatory frameworks have the strongest representation
    in their sample collection and where functional gaps may exist.

  - >
    Consortium Design Insights: Samples with complementary patterns (different
    hotspot locations) can be combined to create biological consortia with
    comprehensive functional coverage across multiple regulatory frameworks.
