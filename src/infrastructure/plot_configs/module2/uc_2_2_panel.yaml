# UC-2.2: Ranking of Samples by Compound Richness
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-2-2"

scientific_question: >
  Which biological samples interact with the widest variety of unique chemical compounds?

description: >
  This visualization ranks each sample based on the total number of unique
  compounds with which it is associated. The resulting bar chart provides a
  clear and direct assessment of the "chemical versatility" of each biological
  source, highlighting those with the broadest interaction capacity.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Y-axis"
    description: "Represents the individual Samples."
  
  - label: "X-axis"
    description: "Represents the absolute count of unique compounds."
  
  - label: "Bar Height and Label"
    description: >
      The height of each bar and its corresponding numerical label
      explicitly state the total unique compound count for that sample.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Chemical Versatility: Taller bars correspond to samples with greater
    chemical versatility, indicating an ability to interact with a broader
    and more diverse repertoire of compounds. These biological sources may be
    considered "generalists."
  
  - >
    Direct Comparison: The chart allows for the direct comparison and
    ranking of samples, which can be useful for identifying potential candidates
    for applications requiring broad interaction capacity.
  
  - >
    Specialized Potential: Samples with shorter bars may have more
    specialized chemical targets or a more limited metabolic scope within
    the context of the analyzed compounds.
