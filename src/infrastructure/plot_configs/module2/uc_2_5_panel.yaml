# UC-2.5: Distribution of KO Across Samples
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-2-5"

scientific_question: >
  How does the statistical distribution of functional richness (unique KO counts)
  compare across different samples and annotation databases, and what insights
  might this provide about their scope and focus?

description: >
  This interactive visualization provides a comparative statistical summary of
  unique KO counts across all analyzed samples, allowing for direct assessment
  of results from different annotation sources. By selecting a database from the
  dropdown menu, the chart dynamically updates to show the distribution for that
  specific dataset. It combines a box plot, which summarizes the distribution,
  with a jittered scatter plot, which shows the position of each individual sample.

      Use this to switch between the BioRemPP, HADEG, and KEGG datasets. The
      visualization updates automatically to show the distribution for the
      selected database.
  
  - label: "Box Plot"
    description: >
      The green box represents the interquartile range (IQR), containing the
      central 50% of the data for the selected database. The line inside the
      box marks the median unique KO count.
  
  - label: "Jittered Points"
    description: >
      Each individual black dot represents a single sample. Its vertical position
      corresponds to its unique KO count. Horizontal jittering prevents overlapping
      points for better visibility.
  
  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering the cursor over any point reveals the sample's name, its exact
      unique KO count, and its rank within that specific dataset.

    Comparing Distributions: By switching between databases, one can compare
    their overall distributions. A database with a higher median KO count
    (e.g., KEGG) may offer broader functional coverage, while another with a
    tighter distribution (a shorter box) may be more consistent in its
    annotation depth across samples.

    Identifying Database-Specific Outliers: A sample that appears as an outlier
    in one database but not another may help identify a specific strength or focus
    of that annotation source (e.g., HADEG identifying exceptionally high KO
    counts for a known hydrocarbon degrader).

    Assessing Annotation Scope: A narrow distribution from a specialized database
    like HADEG versus a wider one from a generalist database like KEGG may provide
    insights into their intended applications and curation strategies.
  
  - >
    Median vs. Mean: The box plot emphasizes the median (middle value) rather
    than the mean, making it robust to outliers. This is particularly useful
    when comparing databases with different annotation philosophies.
