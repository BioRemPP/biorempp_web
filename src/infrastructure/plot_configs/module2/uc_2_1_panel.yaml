# UC-2.1: Ranking of Samples by KO Richness
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-2-1"

scientific_question: >
  How does the ranking of functional richness for each sample
  change when viewed through the lens of different annotation
  databases (BioRemPP, HADEG, KEGG)?

description: >
  This interactive visualization allows for a direct comparison of the
  functional richness of each biological sample across different annotation
  sources. By selecting a database from the dropdown menu, the horizontal
  bar chart dynamically updates to rank each sample based on its total count
  of unique KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers within that specific dataset.
  
  Databases: The user can select from BioRemPP, HADEG, or KEGG to explore
  and compare the resulting functional profiles.

  - label: "Y-axis"
    description: "Represents the individual Samples."
  
  - label: "X-axis"
    description: "Represents the absolute count of unique KOs."
  
  - label: "Bar Length and Label"
    description: >
      The length of each bar and its corresponding numerical label
      explicitly state the total unique KO count for that sample within
      the context of the selected database.

    Comparative Ranking: By switching between databases, one can observe
    how the functional ranking of a sample changes. A sample that ranks highly
    in HADEG but lower in KEGG, for example, may be a specialist in
    hydrocarbon biotransformation, reflecting HADEG's specific scope.

    Identifying Generalists vs. Specialists: Samples that consistently rank
    high across all three databases may be considered robust functional
    "generalists." Those whose ranks vary significantly may have more specialized
    metabolic capabilities that are only captured by certain databases.

    Assessing Database Bias: The differences in rankings may help identify the
    inherent scope and focus of each annotation source. This analysis can help
    assess which database may be most suitable for identifying specific types of
    functional potential.
