# UC-2.3: Ranking of Compound Richness by Sample per Chemical Class
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-2-3"

scientific_question: >
  Within a specific chemical class, which compounds are targeted by the widest
  range of biological samples, suggesting broad bioavailability or common
  biotransformation pathways?

description: >
  This interactive visualization ranks compounds based on the number of unique
  samples that interact with them, filterable by the compound's chemical class.
  The resulting bar chart highlights which compounds are the most common targets
  across the biological samples for a selected category.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Dropdown Menu"
    description: >
      Use this to select the Compound Class to analyze. The plot will update
      automatically.
  
  - label: "X-axis"
    description: "Represents the individual Compounds within the selected class."
  
  - label: "Y-axis"
    description: "Represents the count of unique samples that interact with each compound."
  
  - label: "Bar Height and Label"
    description: >
      The height of each bar and its corresponding numerical label explicitly
      state the total number of unique samples associated with that compound.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    High-Interaction Compounds: Taller bars represent compounds that are acted
    upon by a more diverse set of samples. These may represent common, easily
    processable substrates or key pollutants that may have driven the evolution
    of similar biotransformation pathways across different biological sources.
  
  - >
    Specialized Targets: Shorter bars, especially those with a count of '1',
    represent compounds targeted by only a few, or a single, sample. This may
    indicate a specialized or rare metabolic capability present in only a subset
    of the biological sources.
  
  - >
    Comparing Chemical Classes: The dropdown allows for direct comparison of
    interaction patterns between different chemical classes. For example, one
    can investigate whether compounds in the "Aromatics" class are generally
    targeted by a more diverse set of biological sources than those in the
    "Chlorinated" class.
