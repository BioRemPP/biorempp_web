# UC-2.4: Ranking of Compounds by Genetic Interaction within Chemical Classes
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-2-4"

scientific_question: >
  Within a specific chemical class, which compounds are associated with the
  greatest diversity of unique genes, suggesting they may involve more complex
  or varied enzymatic machinery for biotransformation?

description: >
  This interactive visualization ranks compounds based on the number of unique
  genes that interact with them, filterable by the compound's chemical class.
  The resulting bar chart highlights which compounds elicit the most diverse
  genetic response for a selected category, potentially indicating complex
  biotransformation pathways.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Dropdown Menu"
    description: >
      Use this to select the Compound Class to analyze. The plot will update
      automatically.
  
  - label: "X-axis"
    description: "Represents the individual Compounds within the selected class."
  
  - label: "Y-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the count of unique genes that interact with each compound.
  
  - label: "Bar Height and Label"
    description: >
      The height of each bar and its corresponding numerical label explicitly
      state the total number of unique genes associated with that compound.

    Complex Biotransformation Targets: Taller bars represent compounds that are
    associated with a larger and more diverse set of genes. This may suggest
    a complex, multi-step biotransformation pathway involving numerous different
    enzymes, transporters, or regulatory genes.
  
  - >
    Simple Biotransformation Targets: Shorter bars, especially those with a count of
    '1', may suggest compounds that are targeted by a smaller, more specific, or
    perhaps a single enzymatic pathway.
  
  - >
    Comparing Chemical Classes: The dropdown allows for direct comparison of
    genetic interaction patterns between chemical classes. This can help assess,
    for example, whether compounds in the "Aromatics" class generally involve
    a greater diversity of genetic machinery for biotransformation than those in
    the "Aliphatics" class.
