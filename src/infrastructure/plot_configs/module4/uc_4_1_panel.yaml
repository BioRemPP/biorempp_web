# UC-4.1: Interactive Functional Profiling of Samples by Metabolic Pathway (KEGG)
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-4-1"

scientific_question: >
  What is the specific functional profile of each biological sample, as defined
  by the richness of its annotated metabolic pathways?

description: >
  This interactive visualization allows for the detailed functional profiling
  of individual samples. By selecting a sample from the dropdown menu, the bar
  chart dynamically updates to display and rank all the metabolic pathways
  present in that sample based on the number of unique KEGG Orthology (KO)
  identifiers associated with each pathway.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Dropdown Menu"
    description: >
      Use this to select the Sample to analyze. The plot will update
      automatically.

  - label: "Y-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the individual KEGG Pathways found in the selected sample.

  - label: "X-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the count of unique KOs associated with each pathway.

  - label: "Bar Length and Label"
    description: >
      The length of each bar and its corresponding numerical label explicitly
      state the total number of unique KOs, potentially indicating the functional richness
      of that pathway for the selected sample.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Dominant Pathways: The longest bars represent the most prominent or
    functionally rich metabolic pathways for that specific biological source. This can
    help identify its primary metabolic capabilities or specializations.

  - >
    Comparative Profiling: By switching between samples in the dropdown, one
    can directly compare their functional profiles. For example, this may
    highlight if one sample is enriched in hydrocarbon biotransformation pathways
    while another is specialized in amino acid metabolism.

  - >
    Pathway Presence/Absence: The chart provides a clear inventory of which
    metabolic pathways are encoded in each sample's genome, allowing for quick
    identification of key functional differences.
