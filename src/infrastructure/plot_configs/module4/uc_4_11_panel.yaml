  What is the overall hierarchical structure of genetic diversity within
  HADEG and BioRemPP databases, and how is this diversity distributed among
  different classes of compounds and their specific metabolic pathways or
  compound names?

description: >
  This visualization provides a global, hierarchical overview of genetic
  diversity across selected databases. The sunburst chart illustrates
  hierarchical relationships: HADEG shows Compound → Pathway → Gene, while
  BioRemPP shows Compound_Class → Compound_Name → Gene_Symbol. The size and
  color of each segment represent the number of unique genes or gene symbols
  involved, allowing for comprehensive assessment of the functional landscape.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Concentric Rings (Hierarchy)"
    description: >
      The chart is read from the center outwards. The central circle represents
      the total genetic diversity ("All Pathways"). The first ring breaks this
      down by Compound class (HADEG: "Alkenes", "Aromatics"; BioRemPP:
      Compound_Class), and the outer ring further subdivides each into specific
      Pathways (HADEG) or Compound Names (BioRemPP).

  - label: "Slice Size"
    description: >
      The angular width of each slice is proportional to its unique gene count.
      Larger slices may represent pathways or compound classes that are supported
      by a greater diversity of genes.

  - label: "Color Intensity"
    description: >
      The color of each slice corresponds to its unique gene count, with
      brighter/warmer colors indicating higher genetic diversity.

  - label: "Interactivity"
    description: >
      Click on any slice to "zoom in" and focus on that specific branch of
      the hierarchy, enabling drill-down exploration.

    Dominant Compound Classes: In the inner ring, the largest slices
    represent the compound classes (HADEG: "Alkenes", "Aromatics"; BioRemPP:
    Compound_Class categories) that are associated with the highest overall
    genetic diversity in the dataset.
  - >
    Key Metabolic Pathways: In the outer ring, the largest slices pinpoint
    the specific Pathways (HADEG) or Compound Names (BioRemPP) that are the
    primary contributors to the genetic diversity of their parent compound class.

    Hierarchical Exploration: The chart provides a powerful top-down view.
    It allows for the immediate identification of the most genetically complex
    areas of metabolism (large slices) and can enable interactive exploration of
    their constituent parts by clicking through the layers.
