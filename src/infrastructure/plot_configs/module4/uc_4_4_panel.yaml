# UC-4.4: Interactive Functional Fingerprint of Samples by Pathway (KEGG)
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-4-4"

scientific_question: >
  What is the specific functional fingerprint of each biological sample, as
  defined by the distribution and richness of its annotated metabolic pathways?

description: >
  This interactive visualization allows for the detailed functional profiling
  of individual samples. By selecting a sample from the dropdown menu, the
  radar chart dynamically updates to display its "functional fingerprint"—the
  richness of each metabolic pathway it possesses, measured by the count of
  unique KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Dropdown Menu"
    description: >
      Use this to select the Sample to analyze. The plot will update
      automatically.

  - label: "Axes (theta)"
    description: >
      Each axis radiating from the center represents an individual Metabolic
      Pathway.

  - label: "Value (r)"
    description: >
      The distance of a point from the center along a pathway's axis indicates
      the count of unique KOs that the selected sample possesses for that
      pathway.

  - label: "Shape"
    description: >
      The blue shape connecting the points represents the sample's overall
      "functional fingerprint," showing its strengths across different
      metabolic functions.

    Functional Specialization: The shape of the radar plot can help
    identify a sample's functional specializations. A shape that is heavily
    skewed towards a particular set of related pathways (e.g., several for
    hydrocarbon biotransformation) may indicate a strong specialization in that area.

    Metabolic Breadth: A more balanced, circular shape may suggest a functional
    "generalist" with a broad and evenly distributed metabolic potential
    across many different types of pathways.

  - >
    Comparative Profiling: By switching between samples in the dropdown, one
    can directly compare their functional fingerprints, quickly identifying
    key differences in their metabolic strategies and potential ecological
    niches.
