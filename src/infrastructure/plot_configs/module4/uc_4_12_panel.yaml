# UC-4.12: Interactive Heatmap of Pathway Relationships by Sample (HADEG)
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

scientific_question: >
  For any given biological sample, what is the functional relationship between
  its broader metabolic pathways (Pathway) and the specific chemical classes
  (compound_pathway) they belong to?

description: >
  This interactive visualization provides a functional map of a selected
  sample's metabolic architecture. By choosing a sample from the dropdown menu,
  the heatmap dynamically updates to show the functional richness—measured by
  the count of unique KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers—at the intersection of
  each specific Pathway and its corresponding compound_pathway.

  - label: "Dropdown Menu"
    description: >
      Use this to select the Sample to analyze. The plot will update
      automatically.

  - label: "Y-axis (Rows)"
    description: >
      Represents the specific Pathways found in the selected sample.

  - label: "X-axis (Columns)"
    description: >
      Represents the broader Compound Pathways (chemical classes).

  - label: "Cell Color Intensity"
    description: >
      The color intensity of each cell indicates the count of unique KOs,
      showing how functionally rich a specific pathway is within a broader
      chemical context for that sample.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hover over cells to see exact KO counts and identify specific
      pathway-compound pathway combinations.

    Functional Hotspots: Brightly colored cells (hotspots) may identify a strong
    functional link. This may indicate that a particular metabolic pathway is a
    major contributor to the biotransformation of a broader class of compounds within
    that specific biological source.

  - >
    Sample's Metabolic Strategy: By examining the overall pattern for a
    selected sample, one can infer its metabolic strategy. A sample with many
    hotspots in the "Alkanes" column, for example, may be specialized in
    alkane biotransformation.

  - >
    Comparative Profiling: Switching between samples in the dropdown allows
    for direct comparison of their metabolic maps, potentially highlighting key differences
    in how each biological source organizes its biotransformation capabilities.

  - >
    Pathway Organization: The matrix can help identify how different chemical compound
    classes are associated with distinct metabolic pathways within a single
    sample, showing the biological source's functional organization.

  - >
    Metabolic Breadth vs. Specialization: A sample with many bright cells
    across multiple compound pathway columns has broad metabolic capabilities,
    while one with hotspots concentrated in few columns is a specialist.
