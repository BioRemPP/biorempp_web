# UC-4.6: Interactive Analysis of Functional Potential by Chemical Compound
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

use_case_id: "uc-4-6"

scientific_question: >
  For a given class of chemical compounds, which biological samples exhibit
  the most significant functional potential (measured by KO diversity)
  against which specific compounds?

description: >
  This interactive visualization maps the functional potential of each sample
  against individual compounds, filterable by chemical class. The scatter plot
  uses both size and color to represent the diversity of unique KEGG Orthology
  (KO) identifiers associated with each sample-compound interaction. This
  allows for the rapid identification of "hotspots" of high functional investment.
  Functional potential is quantified as the number of unique KOs, serving as a
  proxy for the complexity of the genetic machinery a sample deploys against
  a compound.

  - label: "Dropdown Menu"
    description: >
      Use this to select the Compound Class to analyze. The plot will update
      automatically upon selection.

  - label: "Y-axis (Compound Names)"
    description: >
      Represents the individual Compound Names within the selected chemical
      class. Each unique compound is displayed on the vertical axis.

  - label: "X-axis (Samples)"
    description: >
      Represents the individual biological samples in your dataset. Each sample
      is displayed on the horizontal axis.

  - label: "Point Size and Color"
    description: >
      Both the size and color intensity of each point correspond to the count
      of unique KOs for that sample-compound interaction. Larger, brighter
      points indicate a higher count of unique KOs, representing stronger
      functional potential.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering the cursor over a point reveals additional details, such as the
      sample name, compound name, and the exact count of unique KOs associated
      with that interaction.

    Functional Hotspots: Large, brightly colored points may represent "hotspots"
    of high functional potential—a strong and diverse genetic response from
    a specific sample towards a specific compound. These may indicate areas where
    the sample has invested significant genetic machinery for biotransformation.

  - >
    Sample Specialization: A sample (vertical column) with numerous large and
    bright points may be identified as a potent candidate for that particular
    chemical class. This can help identify samples with broad functional capabilities
    within the compound class.

  - >
    Compound Complexity: A compound (horizontal row) that elicits a strong
    response (large, bright points) from multiple different samples may be a
    particularly complex or recalcitrant molecule that may require a diverse
    enzymatic toolkit for its biotransformation.

  - >
    Comparative Functional Investment: By comparing vertical patterns (samples),
    you can identify which biological sources invest the most genetic resources into
    biotransforming compounds within the selected chemical class, potentially highlighting
    potential bioaugmentation candidates.

  - >
    Specialized vs. Generalist Degraders: Samples with isolated large points
    are specialists (effective against specific compounds), while samples with
    many medium-sized points are generalists (broad but moderate capability
    across many compounds).
