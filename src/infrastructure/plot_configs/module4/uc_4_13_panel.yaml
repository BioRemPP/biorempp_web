# UC-4.13: Interactive Genetic Profile by Compound Pathway (HADEG)
# Panel Configuration (Informative Collapsible Panel)

scientific_question: >
  For a given class of chemical pathways (e.g., Alkanes), which specific genes
  are present in which biological samples, and what does this reveal about the
  genetic strategies employed for biotransforming these compounds?

description: >
  This interactive visualization provides a detailed genetic profile of the
  sample consortium for a user-selected compound pathway. By choosing a pathway
  from the dropdown menu, the heatmap dynamically updates to display the
  functional richness—measured by the count of unique KEGG Orthology (KO)
  identifiers—for each gene across all samples.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Dropdown Menu"
    description: >
      Use this to select the Compound Pathway to analyze. The plot will update
      automatically.

  - label: "Y-axis (Rows)"
    description: >
      Represents the individual Genes associated with the selected compound
      pathway.

  - label: "X-axis (Columns)"
    description: >
      Represents the individual Samples in your dataset.

  - label: "Cell Color Intensity"
    description: >
      The color intensity of each cell indicates the count of unique KOs,
      showing the functional diversity of a specific gene within a specific
      sample for the chosen pathway.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hover over cells to see exact KO counts and identify specific
      gene-sample combinations.

    Functional Hotspots: Brightly colored cells (hotspots) may identify a strong
    functional link, potentially indicating that a particular sample possesses a high
    diversity of KOs for a specific gene, potentially suggesting that gene's importance
    or complexity in that biological source.

  - >
    Key Genetic Players: Rows with consistently high values across multiple
    samples may represent core genes that are widely distributed and functionally
    important for biotransforming that class of compounds.

  - >
    Sample Specialization: Columns with numerous bright cells may highlight the
    samples that are the most genetically well-equipped to handle the selected
    compound pathway, potentially identifying them as functional "specialists."

  - >
    Genetic Profile Matrix: The matrix can help identify the gene presence and
    functional diversity across different samples, enabling comparative
    analysis of genetic strategies.

  - >
    Pathway-Specific Analysis: By switching between compound pathways in the
    dropdown, you can compare how different chemical compound classes are
    associated with distinct genetic profiles across your sample consortium.
