# UC-4.9: Interactive Profiling of Sample Enzymatic Activity
# Informative Panel Configuration

use_case_id: "uc-4-9"

scientific_question: >
  For any given biological sample, which enzymatic functions are the most
  prominent, as measured by the diversity of unique genes associated with them?

description: >
  This interactive visualization provides a detailed functional profile of a
  selected sample by ranking its annotated enzyme activities. By choosing a
  sample from the dropdown menu, the bar chart dynamically updates to display
  the number of unique gene symbols associated with each enzymatic function.
  This may highlight the enzymatic capabilities that are most genetically diverse
  within that biological source.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Dropdown Menu"
    description: >
      Use this to select the Sample to analyze. The plot will update automatically.

  - label: "X-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the individual Enzyme Activities found in the selected sample.

  - label: "Y-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the count of unique genes associated with each enzyme activity.

  - label: "Bar Height and Label"
    description: >
      The height of each bar and its corresponding numerical label explicitly
      state the total number of unique genes for that function.

    **Genetic Investment**: Taller bars may represent enzyme activities that are
    supported by a larger and more diverse set of genes. This may suggest a
    significant genetic investment by the biological source in that particular function,
    potentially indicating its importance.

    **Functional Specialization**: The ranking of enzyme activities can help identify
    the functional specialization of the selected sample. For example, a
    biological source showing high gene counts for 'oxidoreductase' and 'monooxygenase'
    may be specialized in oxidative biotransformation pathways.

  - >
    **Comparative Functional Profiling**: By switching between samples, one
    can directly compare their enzymatic profiles. This may highlight key
    functional differences, such as one biological source relying heavily on 'hydrolase'
    activities while another prioritizes 'transferase' functions.
