scientific_question: >
  What are the specific associations between individual genes and chemical
  compounds, and which biological samples mediate these interactions?

description: >
  This interactive visualization serves as a query tool to explore the direct
  links between gene symbols and compound names. By using one or both dropdown
  menus, a user can dynamically filter the entire dataset to visualize specific
  relationships. The resulting scatter plot maps the presence of these
  associations, providing a powerful tool for hypothesis testing and detailed
  exploration. Each point in the plot represents an observed association between
  a gene symbol and a compound name from the BioRemPP results.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Dropdown Menus"
    description: >
      Use the "Select Compound Name" and "Select Gene Symbol" menus to filter
      the data. The plot updates automatically based on your selection(s). You
      can select one or both filters to explore different perspectives.

  - label: "Y-axis (Compound Names)"
    description: >
      Represents the chemical compound names identified in the analysis. Each
      unique compound is displayed on the vertical axis.

  - label: "X-axis (Gene Symbols)"
    description: >
      Represents the gene symbols associated with the compounds. Each unique
      gene is displayed on the horizontal axis.

  - label: "Points (Associations)"
    description: >
      A point at the intersection of a gene and a compound indicates that an
      association between them was found in the data. The presence of a point
      confirms this functional link exists in at least one sample.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering the cursor over a point reveals which sample and KO identifier
      are responsible for that specific gene-compound association, enabling
      detailed traceability.

    Single Filter (Compound-centric view): Selecting a single compound can help identify
    its "genetic interaction profile"—the complete set of genes known to be
    associated with it in this dataset. This view can help identify which genes
    are involved in biotransforming or processing a specific compound.

  - >
    Single Filter (Gene-centric view): Selecting a single gene can help identify its
    "chemical substrate profile"—the complete set of compounds it is known to
    target. This view can help understand the functional versatility of a specific
    gene across different substrates.

  - >
    Dual Filter (Hypothesis Testing): Selecting both a gene and a compound
    allows for direct confirmation of a specific interaction. This is useful
    for validating hypotheses about specific gene-compound relationships.

  - >
    Sample Identification: The hover data can help identify precisely which samples
    possess each functional link, providing evidence for targeted analysis and
    potentially helping identify samples with specific capabilities.

  - >
    Functional Network Mapping: By exploring different combinations of genes
    and compounds, you can map the functional network of biotransformation
    pathways present in your biological consortium, potentially revealing redundancy,
    specialization, and functional gaps.
