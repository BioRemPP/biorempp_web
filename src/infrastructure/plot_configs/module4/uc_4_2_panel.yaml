# UC-4.2: Interactive Ranking of Samples by Pathway Richness (KEGG)
# Informative Panel Configuration

use_case_id: "uc-4-2"

scientific_question: >
  For any given metabolic pathway, which biological samples possess the highest
  functional richness or completeness, as measured by their unique KO count?

description: >
  This interactive visualization allows for the comparative analysis of
  functional potential at the pathway level. By selecting a metabolic pathway
  from the dropdown menu, the bar chart dynamically updates to rank each sample
  based on the number of unique KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers it possesses
  for that specific pathway.

      Use this to select the Metabolic Pathway to analyze. The plot will
      update automatically.

  - label: "X-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the individual Samples.

  - label: "Y-axis"
    description: >
      Represents the count of unique KOs associated with the selected pathway.

  - label: "Bar Height and Label"
    description: >
      The height of each bar and its corresponding numerical label explicitly
      state the total number of unique KOs for that sample within the chosen
      pathway.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    **Pathway Completeness/Richness**: Taller bars may indicate that a sample
    possesses a greater number of unique KOs for the selected pathway. This
    can serve as a proxy for the completeness or functional complexity of
    that pathway within the biological source.

    **Identifying Functional Specialists**: By selecting a specific pathway
    (e.g., "Toluene biotransformation"), the chart can help identify which
    samples are the most potent "specialists" for that function.

  - >
    **Comparative Functional Genomics**: The tool enables rapid comparative
    functional genomics, allowing the user to explore how different biological sources
    are equipped to handle various metabolic tasks. A sample that consistently
    ranks high across many biotransformation pathways may be considered a versatile
    "generalist."
