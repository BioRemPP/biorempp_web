scientific_question: >
  Which genes exhibit potential functional relationships, as inferred by their
  shared interactions with the same chemical compounds, and what is the
  structure of these functional modules?

description: >
  This visualization constructs a network to map the functional relationships
  between genes. In this graph, nodes represent individual gene symbols. An
  edge (a connecting line) is drawn between two genes if they are both
  associated with at least one common chemical compound. This approach allows
  for the identification of "functional modules" - groups of genes that likely
  operate in related pathways or on similar substrates.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Nodes (Points)"
    description: >
      Each point represents a single Gene Symbol. The position is determined
      by a force-directed layout algorithm that groups connected genes together.

  - label: "Edges (Lines)"
    description: >
      A line connecting two genes indicates that they share at least one
      chemical compound target. The width of the edge is proportional to the
      number of shared compounds.

  - label: "Node Color"
    description: >
      The color of a node represents its degree - the number of other genes
      it is connected to within this network. The color bar provides a
      quantitative scale, with brighter/warmer colors indicating "hub" genes
      that are connected to many other genes.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over a node displays the gene symbol and its connection count.
      Hovering over an edge shows the two connected genes and the number of
      shared compounds.

  - label: "Network Layout"
    description: >
      The spring layout algorithm positions nodes so that connected genes are
      closer together, naturally revealing cluster structures in the network.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Functional Modules: Dense clusters of interconnected nodes represent
    functional modules - groups of genes that are likely co-regulated or part
    of the same or related metabolic pathways, given that they target a
    similar set of chemical substrates.

  - >
    Hub Genes: Brightly colored nodes are highly connected "hubs" within the
    network. These may represent key regulatory genes, genes encoding enzymes
    with broad substrate specificity, or central components that link
    different metabolic functions.

  - >
    Bridge Genes: A gene that connects two otherwise distinct clusters can be
    interpreted as a functional bridge, potentially linking two different
    metabolic pathways.

  - >
    Edge Weight: Thicker edges between genes may indicate they share more compounds,
    potentially suggesting stronger functional relationships and potentially coordinated
    regulation or sequential enzymatic activity.

  - >
    Isolated Genes: Genes with few or no connections may be specialists with
    unique substrate specificities, or they may represent rare functions in
    the dataset that don't overlap with other genetic capabilities.
