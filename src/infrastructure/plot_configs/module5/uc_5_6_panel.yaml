scientific_question: >
  Which chemical compounds are likely processed by similar enzymatic machinery,
  as inferred by their shared interactions with the same genes, and what is the
  structure of these chemically related groups?

description: >
  This visualization constructs a network to map the functional relationships
  between chemical compounds. In this graph, nodes represent individual compound
  names. An edge (a connecting line) is drawn between two compounds if they are
  both targeted by at least one common gene. This approach helps to identify
  clusters of compounds that may be structurally similar or part of the same
  degradation pathways.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Nodes (Points)"
    description: >
      Each point represents a single Compound Name. The position is determined
      by a force-directed layout algorithm that groups connected compounds together.

  - label: "Edges (Lines)"
    description: >
      A line connecting two compounds indicates that they are targeted by at
      least one common gene. The presence of an edge may suggest functional
      similarity in their processing mechanisms.

  - label: "Edge Thickness"
    description: >
      A thicker line signifies a stronger functional relationship, as the two
      connected compounds are targeted by a larger number of common genes.

  - label: "Node Color"
    description: >
      The color of a node represents its degree - the number of other compounds
      it is connected to within this network. The color bar provides a
      quantitative scale, with brighter/warmer colors indicating "hub" compounds
      that are functionally linked to many others.

  - label: "Network Layout"
    description: >
      The spring layout algorithm positions nodes so that connected compounds
      are closer together, naturally revealing cluster structures in the network.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Chemical Clusters: Dense clusters of interconnected nodes represent groups
    of compounds that are functionally related. These may be structurally
    similar chemicals, co-contaminants, or compounds that are processed by a
    common and versatile set of enzymes.

  - >
    Hub Compounds: Brightly colored nodes are highly connected "hubs" in the
    network. These may represent central intermediates in degradation cascades
    or versatile molecules that are targeted by a wide array of genetic machinery.

  - >
    Bridge Compounds: A node that connects two otherwise distinct clusters can
    be interpreted as a functional "bridge" compound, potentially linking two
    different classes of chemicals via a shared set of enzymes.

  - >
    Edge Weight: Thicker edges between compounds may indicate they share more genes,
    potentially suggesting stronger functional relationships and potentially similar chemical
    structures or biotransformation requirements.

  - >
    Isolated Compounds: Compounds with few or no connections may be unique
    substrates processed by specialized enzymes not shared with other compounds
    in the dataset.
