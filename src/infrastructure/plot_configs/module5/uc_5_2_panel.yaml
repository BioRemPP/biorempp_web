# UC-5.2: Sample Similarity Based on Shared Chemical Profiles
# Panel Configuration (YAML)

use_case_id: "uc-5-2"

scientific_question: >
  How functionally similar are the biological samples to one another, based on
  the shared repertoire of chemical compounds they interact with, and what is
  the structure of these functional guilds?

description: >
  This visualization assesses the pairwise similarity between all biological
  samples based on their shared chemical interaction profiles. The chord
  diagram is constructed from a derived set of connections where the strength
  of the link between any two samples is quantified by the number of compounds
  they have in common. This can help identify biological sources with analogous
  chemical interaction capabilities.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Outer Arcs"
    description: >
      Each colored arc on the circumference represents an individual Sample.
      The length of the arc is proportional to its total shared interactions
      with all other samples.

  - label: "Chords (Ribbons)"
    description: >
      The ribbons flowing between two arcs represent the similarity between
      that pair of samples.

  - label: "Chord Thickness"
    description: >
      The thickness of a chord is directly proportional to the number of
      shared compounds, indicating the strength of the functional similarity.

  - label: "Node Colors"
    description: >
      Each sample is assigned a distinct color for easy identification
      across the diagram.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over a chord displays the exact number of shared compounds
      between the connected sample pair.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Functional Guilds: Thick chords connecting a group of samples may identify
    functional guilds - clusters of biological sources that likely target a similar
    range of chemical substrates and may share similar ecological niches
    or metabolic strategies.

  - >
    High Similarity: A thick chord between two specific samples indicates
    that they have very similar chemical interaction profiles.

  - >
    Unique Profiles: A sample with only thin chords connecting to others
    may possess a more unique or specialized chemical interaction profile
    compared to the rest of the consortium.

  - >
    Consortium Redundancy: Highly interconnected samples may provide
    functional redundancy, which can be beneficial for robust bioremediation
    but may also indicate potential overlap in capabilities.

  - >
    Core vs Peripheral Samples: Samples with many thick connections form
    the core of functional similarity, while those with few connections
    are peripheral specialists.
