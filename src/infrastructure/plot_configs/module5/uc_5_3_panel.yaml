# UC-5.3: Regulatory Relevance of Samples
# Panel Configuration (YAML)

use_case_id: "uc-5-3"

scientific_question: >
  Which biological samples are most functionally relevant to the compounds
  monitored by different environmental regulatory agencies?

description: >
  This visualization maps the interaction strength between each biological
  sample and the various regulatory agencies represented in the dataset.
  The chord diagram provides a clear overview of these relationships, where
  the connections illustrate the magnitude of functional associations within
  each regulatory context.

visual_elements:
  - label: "Outer Arcs"
    description: >
      Each colored arc on the circumference represents either a Sample or a
      Regulatory Agency. The length of the arc is proportional to the total
      number of interactions associated with it.

  - label: "Chords (Ribbons)"
    description: >
      The ribbons flowing between the arcs represent the interactions between
      a specific sample and a specific agency.

  - label: "Chord Thickness"
    description: >
      The thickness of a chord where it connects to an arc is proportional to
      the number of interactions. A thick chord indicates a strong association.

  - label: "Agency Dropdown Selector"
    description: >
      A dropdown control allows selecting a specific regulatory agency to focus
      the visualization. When selected, the diagram shows only interactions
      involving the chosen agency.

  - label: "Node Colors"
    description: >
      Each category (sample or regulatory agency) is assigned a distinct color
      for easy identification across the diagram.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    High Regulatory Relevance: A thick chord between a sample (e.g.,
    Acinetobacter) and an agency (e.g., "EPC") indicates that this sample
    possesses a high number of genetic functions related to compounds
    regulated by that agency.

  - >
    Identifying Key Biological Sources: Samples with multiple thick chords connecting
    to various agencies are functionally versatile and relevant across several
    regulatory contexts. Conversely, a sample with one dominant chord may be
    a specialist for a particular set of regulated pollutants.

  - >
    Agency Impact: A regulatory agency that is the target of many thick chords
    from different samples has a broad footprint in the dataset, meaning its
    list of target compounds is associated with widespread metabolic
    capabilities across the consortium.

  - >
    Comparative Assessment: By comparing the chord thickness across different
    sample-agency pairs, one can assess which samples may be most valuable
    for addressing specific regulatory priorities.

  - >
    Consortium Design: This visualization can help identify samples that
    complement each other across different regulatory contexts.
