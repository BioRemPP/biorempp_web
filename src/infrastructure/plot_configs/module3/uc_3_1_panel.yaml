scientific_question: >
  How do biological samples cluster in functional space based on their
  KEGG Orthology (KO) profiles? Which samples exhibit similar metabolic
  potentials, and which represent distinct functional strategies?

description: >
  This visualization employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the
  high-dimensional space of KO presence/absence profiles into two principal
  components for visualization. Each point represents a sample, positioned
  according to its scores on PC1 and PC2. The analysis can help identify natural
  groupings, outliers, and the overall structure of functional diversity
  within the dataset. Samples with similar KO repertoires cluster together,
  while functionally distinct samples appear farther apart.

visual_elements:
  - label: "X-axis (PC1)"
    description: >
      Principal Component 1 captures the largest variance in the KO profiles.
      The axis label shows the percentage of total variance explained by PC1.
      Samples spread along this axis differ most strongly in the features
      that contribute to PC1.

  - label: "Y-axis (PC2)"
    description: >
      Principal Component 2 captures the second-largest variance orthogonal
      to PC1. The axis label shows the percentage of variance explained by PC2.
      Together, PC1 and PC2 provide a 2D projection that preserves major
      patterns of sample relationships.

  - label: "Points (Samples)"
    description: >
      Each point represents one biological sample. Points are colored by
      sample identity, making it easy to track individual samples and
      identify clusters.

  - label: "Point Color"
    description: >
      Colors distinguish individual samples. Samples of the same color are
      the same biological source. The color legend on the right shows all
      samples included in the analysis.

  - label: "Clustering"
    description: >
      Samples that appear close together in the plot have similar KO profiles,
      indicating functional similarity. Distinct clusters may suggest different
      functional groups or metabolic strategies within the community.

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over each point displays the sample name and its PC1/PC2 scores,
      facilitating identification and comparison.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Functional Clusters: Tight groups of samples indicate shared metabolic
    profiles. These clusters may represent biological sources with similar
    ecological niches, phylogenetic relationships, or bioremediation strategies.

  - >
    Outliers: Samples positioned far from others possess unique or rare
    functional repertoires. These may be specialists with distinctive
    metabolic capabilities worth investigating further.

  - >
    Variance Explained: The percentages on the axes indicate how much of the
    total functional diversity is captured. Higher values (>50% combined)
    suggest the 2D plot faithfully represents the major patterns. Lower values
    indicate more complexity in the dataset that isn't fully visualized in 2D.

  - >
    Gradient Patterns: If samples form a gradient rather than discrete clusters,
    this may suggest a continuum of functional variation rather than distinct
    functional types.

  - >
    Sample Diversity: The overall spread of points reflects the functional
    diversity of the community. Tightly packed samples may indicate functional
    redundancy, while widely dispersed samples may indicate high functional diversity.

  - >
    Bioremediation Applications: Functionally similar samples (clustering together)
    may have redundant bioremediation capabilities. Dissimilar samples may offer
    complementary functions for consortium design.
