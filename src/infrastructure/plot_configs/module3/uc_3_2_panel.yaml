scientific_question: >
  How do biological samples cluster in chemical space based on their compound
  interaction profiles? Which samples exhibit similar biotransformation potentials
  for different compound classes, and which represent distinct biotransformation
  strategies?

description: >
  This visualization employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the
  high-dimensional space of compound presence/absence profiles into two principal
  components for visualization. Each point represents a sample, positioned
  according to its scores on PC1 and PC2. The analysis can help identify natural
  groupings based on biotransformation capabilities, outliers, and the overall
  structure of chemical diversity within the dataset. Samples with similar
  compound interaction repertoires cluster together, while samples with
  distinct interaction profiles appear farther apart.

visual_elements:
  - label: "X-axis (PC1)"
    description: >
      Principal Component 1 captures the largest variance in the compound
      interaction profiles. The axis label shows the percentage of total
      variance explained by PC1. Samples spread along this axis differ most
      strongly in the compound classes they can interact with.

  - label: "Y-axis (PC2)"
    description: >
      Principal Component 2 captures the second-largest variance orthogonal
      to PC1. The axis label shows the percentage of variance explained by PC2.
      Together, PC1 and PC2 provide a 2D projection that preserves major
      patterns of compound interaction capabilities.

  - label: "Points (Samples)"
    description: >
      Each point represents one biological sample. Points are colored by
      sample identity, making it easy to track individual samples and
      identify clusters based on interaction profiles.

  - label: "Point Color"
    description: >
      Colors distinguish individual samples. Samples of the same color are
      the same biological source. The color legend on the right shows all
      samples included in the analysis.

  - label: "Clustering"
    description: >
      Samples that appear close together in the plot have similar compound
      interaction profiles, indicating they can interact with similar sets of
      pollutants. Distinct clusters may suggest specialized biotransformation strategies
      for different compound classes (e.g., aromatics, aliphatics, heterocycles).

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over each point displays the sample name and its PC1/PC2 scores,
      facilitating identification and comparison of interaction capabilities.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Biotransformation Clusters: Tight groups of samples indicate shared compound
    interaction profiles. These clusters may represent specialists for
    particular pollutant classes (e.g., PAH degraders, BTEX degraders,
    aliphatic hydrocarbon degraders).

  - >
    Generalists vs. Specialists: Samples in the center of the plot may be
    generalists capable of interacting with diverse compound classes. Samples at
    the periphery may be specialists with narrow but potent biotransformation
    capabilities for specific pollutants.

  - >
    Complementary Interactions: Samples positioned far apart in the plot have
    complementary interaction profiles. These are ideal candidates for
    biological consortia designed to handle complex pollutant mixtures.

  - >
    Variance Explained: The percentages on the axes indicate how much of the
    total interaction diversity is captured. Higher combined percentages
    (>50%) may suggest the 2D plot faithfully represents interaction patterns.
    Lower values may indicate more complexity in interaction capabilities.

  - >
    Biotransformation Potential: The overall spread may reflect the diversity of
    biotransformation strategies in the community. Wide dispersion may indicate high
    functional diversity and potential for interacting with diverse pollutant mixtures.

  - >
    Outliers: Samples far from others possess unique biotransformation capabilities
    for rare or recalcitrant compounds. These are valuable candidates for
    bioaugmentation of contaminated sites with specific pollutants.

  - >
    Consortium Design: Samples from different clusters with low overlap can
    be combined to create consortia with broad-spectrum biotransformation capabilities,
    ideal for complex contamination scenarios with multiple pollutant classes.
