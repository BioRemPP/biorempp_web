# UC-3.6: Gene Co-occurrence Patterns Across Samples
# Panel Configuration (YAML)

use_case_id: "uc-3-6"

scientific_question: >
  Which genes tend to co-occur across the biological samples, suggesting
  potential functional relationships, co-regulation, or presence in the
  same metabolic pathways?

description: >
  This visualization explores the pairwise co-occurrence relationships
  between all identified gene symbols. The correlogram is constructed
  based on how frequently any two genes are found within the same sample
  across the entire dataset, providing a map of potential functional
  linkages between genes.

visual_elements:
  - label: "X-axis and Y-axis"
    description: >
      Both axes represent the unique Gene Symbols found in the dataset.
      Each cell in the matrix corresponds to a pairwise comparison
      between two genes.

  - label: "Cell Color"
    description: >
      The color of the cell at the intersection of two genes indicates
      the correlation coefficient between their presence profiles
      across all samples.

  - label: "Color Scale"
    description: >
      The plot uses a diverging color scale (RdBu_r). Warm colors (reds)
      signify a high positive correlation (high co-occurrence), indicating
      that two genes are frequently found together. Cool colors (blues)
      indicate negative correlation (mutually exclusive patterns).
      Values range from -1 to +1.

  - label: "Diagonal"
    description: >
      The central diagonal is always bright red, as each gene is perfectly
      correlated with itself (r = 1.0).

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over each cell displays the two gene symbols being compared
      and their exact correlation coefficient value.

    Functional Modules: Brightly colored squares or blocks off the main
    diagonal identify clusters of genes that frequently co-occur. These
    may represent functional modules, such as genes belonging to the same
    metabolic pathway, an operon, or a co-regulated system.

  - >
    Core Functional Cassettes: A gene that shows strong positive correlation
    with many other genes might be part of a core, widely distributed
    functional cassette that is essential for a common metabolic process.

  - >
    Mutually Exclusive Patterns: While less common with presence/absence
    data, strong negative correlations (if observed) could suggest that
    the presence of one gene is associated with the absence of another,
    potentially suggesting alternative or redundant metabolic strategies.

  - >
    Pathway Inference: Co-occurring genes may participate in the same
    biochemical pathway, providing clues for functional annotation of
    uncharacterized genes based on their association patterns.

  - >
    Horizontal Gene Transfer: Clusters of co-occurring genes across
    diverse samples may suggest mobile genetic elements or horizontally
    transferred gene cassettes.
