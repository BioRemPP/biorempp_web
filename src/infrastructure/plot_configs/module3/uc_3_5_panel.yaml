use_case_id: "uc-3-5"

scientific_question: >
  How similar are the biological samples to one another, based on the shared
  repertoire of chemical compounds they interact with?

description: >
  This visualization assesses the pairwise similarity between all biological
  samples based on their shared chemical interaction profiles. The correlogram
  is constructed from a correlation matrix where the similarity between any
  two samples is quantified by the compounds they have in common. This helps
  to identify biological sources with analogous chemical interaction capabilities.

visual_elements:
  - label: "X-axis and Y-axis"
    description: >
      Both axes represent the individual Samples (biological samples under
      investigation). Each cell in the matrix corresponds to a pairwise
      comparison between two samples.

  - label: "Cell Color"
    description: >
      The color of the cell at the intersection of two samples indicates
      the correlation coefficient between their compound profiles.

  - label: "Color Scale"
    description: >
      The plot uses a diverging color scale (RdBu_r). Warm colors (reds)
      signify a high positive correlation (high similarity), indicating
      that two samples interact with a very similar set of compounds.
      Cool colors (blues) indicate negative correlation (dissimilar profiles).
      Values range from -1 to +1.

  - label: "Diagonal"
    description: >
      The central diagonal is always bright red, as each sample is perfectly
      correlated with itself (r = 1.0).

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over each cell displays the two sample names being compared
      and their exact correlation coefficient value.

interpretation_guidelines:
  - >
    Functional Guilds: Brightly colored squares or blocks off the main
    diagonal identify clusters of samples with highly similar chemical
    interaction profiles. These may represent "functional guilds" - groups
    of biological sources that likely compete for or collaboratively process
    the same chemical substrates in an environment.

  - >
    Distinct Degradative Strategies: The overall structure of the heatmap
    may help identify distinct groups of samples that target different classes
    of chemicals, indicating diverse metabolic capabilities.

  - >
    Unique Chemical Specialists: A sample that shows low correlation
    (neutral or cool colors) with most other samples may possess a more
    unique or specialized chemical interaction profile within this dataset.

  - >
    Consortium Design: Identifying samples with complementary (low
    correlation) chemical profiles can guide the design of biological
    consortia with diverse and non-overlapping interaction capabilities.

  - >
    Bioremediation Potential: Samples with high similarity in compound
    profiles may be functionally redundant, while diverse samples could
    offer broader coverage for multi-contaminant remediation strategies.
