# UC-3.7: Compound Co-occurrence Patterns Across Samples
# Panel Configuration (YAML)

use_case_id: "uc-3-7"

scientific_question: >
  Which chemical compounds tend to be acted upon together across the biological
  samples, suggesting they might be part of the same biotransformation pathway,
  co-contaminants, or require similar enzymatic machinery?

description: >
  This visualization explores the pairwise co-occurrence relationships
  between all identified compound names. The correlogram is constructed
  based on how frequently any two compounds are found within the same sample
  across the entire dataset, providing a map of potential chemical or
  metabolic linkages.

visual_elements:
  - label: "X-axis and Y-axis"
    description: >
      Both axes represent the unique Compound Names found in the dataset.
      Each cell in the matrix corresponds to a pairwise comparison
      between two compounds.

  - label: "Cell Color"
    description: >
      The color of the cell at the intersection of two compounds indicates
      the correlation coefficient between their presence profiles
      across all samples.

  - label: "Color Scale"
    description: >
      The plot uses a diverging color scale (RdBu_r). Warm colors (reds)
      signify a high positive correlation (high co-occurrence), indicating
      that two compounds are frequently found together. Cool colors (blues)
      would indicate negative correlation (mutually exclusive patterns).
      Values range from -1 to +1.

  - label: "Diagonal"
    description: >
      The central diagonal is always bright red, as each compound is perfectly
      correlated with itself (r = 1.0).

  - label: "Hover Information"
    description: >
      Hovering over each cell displays the two compound names being compared
      and their exact correlation coefficient value.

    Metabolic or Contamination Clusters: Brightly colored squares or blocks
    off the main diagonal identify clusters of compounds that frequently
    co-occur. These may represent degradation pathways (sequential
    intermediates), co-contaminants (pollutants typically found together),
    or compounds requiring similar enzymatic machinery.

  - >
    Biotransformation Pathways: Compounds that are sequential intermediates in a
    single metabolic biotransformation pathway will show strong positive
    correlations, as they are processed together by the same biological sources.

  - >
    Co-contaminants: Pollutants that are typically found together in the
    environment (e.g., different components of crude oil, PAH mixtures)
    will cluster together in the correlogram.

  - >
    Shared Enzymatic Machinery: Structurally similar compounds that are
    acted upon by the same versatile enzymes (e.g., broad-specificity
    dioxygenases) will show co-occurrence patterns.

  - >
    Distinct Chemical Groups: The overall structure may help identify distinct
    groups of chemicals that are treated similarly by the biological
    samples, helping identify functional specialization.
