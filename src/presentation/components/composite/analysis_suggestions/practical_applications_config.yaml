    title: "Emerging Contaminants in Bioremediation"
    icon: "fas fa-flask-vial"
    color: "danger"
    summary: |
      Emerging contaminants include pharmaceuticals, personal care products,
      per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), endocrine-disrupting
      compounds (EDCs) and micro- or nanoplastics. These chemicals are often
      persistent, bioaccumulative and poorly removed by conventional treatment
      systems, making them a major focus of current bioremediation research.
    why_relevant: |
      Modeling the degradation potential of emerging contaminants requires
      integration of genomic data with detailed chemical and toxicological
      information. BioRemPP can help prioritize samples and pathways with
      predicted activity against PPCPs, PFAS and EDCs in real-world systems.
    suggested_questions:
      - "Which isolates or consortia carry genes and pathways associated with the degradation of PFAS, PPCPs or EDCs?"
      - "Is there enrichment of oxidoreductases, hydrolases or dioxygenases related to specific groups of emerging contaminants?"
      - "Which samples have the highest predicted capacity to treat mixtures of emerging pollutants in effluents or soils?"

    summary: |
      PFAS and other fluorinated compounds are extremely persistent due to the
      strength of the C-F bond. Recent reviews emphasize efforts to identify
      microbes, enzymes and pathways capable of partial or complete defluorination,
      often in combination with physical and chemical treatment strategies.
    why_relevant: |
      Assessing the presence of genes and pathways related to defluorination can
      guide the selection of strains and consortia for PFAS-focused remediation,
      one of the most challenging and dynamic areas in environmental biotechnology.
    suggested_questions:
      - "Do any samples contain KO terms or genes associated with defluorination or metabolism of fluorinated compounds?"
      - "Are there incomplete pathways that could be complemented by assembling consortia, with one species performing defluorination and another mineralizing intermediates?"

      There is growing interest in natural and synthetic microbial consortia for
      remediation of heavy metals, hydrocarbons, pesticides and other persistent
      pollutants. Recent work highlights metabolic complementarity, ecological
      robustness and the potential to engineer targeted consortia.
    why_relevant: |
      BioRemPP can help design and compare consortia by evaluating pathway
      coverage, functional redundancy and specialization across different
      combinations of samples.
    suggested_questions:

      Integrated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches
      are increasingly used to unravel degradation mechanisms, identify functional
      biomarkers and guide the design of more efficient remediation strategies.
    why_relevant: |
      BioRemPP can act as a genomic annotation layer that users can integrate with
      their own expression and metabolomic data, allowing them to assess how well
      predicted potential translates into real activity in the field or in reactors.

    summary: |
      The use of purified enzymes, nanozymes and immobilized biocatalysts is
      expanding for the treatment of emerging contaminants, often in combination
      with nanostructured materials. Enzyme-inspired nanozymes have been explored
      for degradation of pesticides, dyes and other persistent pollutants.
    why_relevant: |
      Mapping genes encoding key enzymes (laccases, peroxidases, monooxygenases,
      hydrolases) helps identify organisms as sources of biocatalysts or as
      targets for enzyme engineering, and supports the design of hybrid bio/nano
      remediation systems.
