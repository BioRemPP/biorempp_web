use_case_id: "uc-demo-guide"

# Module description metadata
module:
  id: "2"
  title: "Exploratory Analysis: Functional Potential"
  overview: >
    This module quantifies how samples contribute to the overall functional richness,
    ranking them by the diversity of genes (KO counts) and degradable compounds
    present in their genomic profiles.

# Guiding questions for demonstration
guiding_questions:
  - id: "2.1"
    subtitle: "Sample performance"
    question: "Which samples exhibit the highest diversity of functional genes?"
    chart_hint: "Charts below: KO and compound-based ranking"

  - id: "2.2"
    subtitle: "Compound coverage"
    question: "Which pollutant compounds are most represented across samples?"
    chart_hint: "Comparative compound richness analysis"

  - id: "2.3"
    subtitle: "Distribution patterns"
    question: "How are functional genes distributed across the dataset?"
    chart_hint: "Box plots and scatter analysis"

# Panel information (use case description)
panel:
  scientific_question: >
    How does the ranking of functional richness for each sample
    change when viewed through the lens of different annotation
    databases (BioRemPP, HADEG, KEGG)?

  description: >
    This interactive visualization allows for a direct comparison of the
    functional richness of each microbial sample across different annotation
    sources. By selecting a database from the dropdown menu, the bar chart
    dynamically updates to rank each sample based on its total count
    of unique KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers.

  interpretation_guidelines:
    - >
      Comparative Ranking: Switching databases reveals how sample rankings
      change based on annotation source specialization.

    - >
      Identifying Specialists: Samples ranking high in HADEG but lower in
      KEGG likely specialize in hydrocarbon degradation.

    - >
      Database Scope: Differences highlight each database's focus, helping
      select the most appropriate source for specific analyses.
